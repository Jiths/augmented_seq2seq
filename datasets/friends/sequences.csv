 Hi, my names Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source? |7| Hey. 
 Sydney Portier? Hehheh. _B_ |9|  Okay, great! Bye.  So guess whos coming to Thanksgiving dinner?

 Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, theres a big selling calendar, eh? |3| Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Gellers class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!" 
 Okay. |5| Okay, Chandler! 
 Hey! |8|  Hi, you guys. 
 Hey. |8| Hey, whats going on? 
 No, no, no. No-no-no. Joey, Rachel, and |7|  Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!

 New haircut?  Necklace?  Dress?  Boots?  Boots! |6| Hey! So what do you think? 
 Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it? |5| Hey! I got you a present!! 
 Hi! |9| And that's why, no matter what mommy says, we really were on a break.  Yes we were! Yes we were!  Come here gorgeous.  Oh! Look at you! You are the cutest little baby ever! You're just a... a little bitty baby, you know that? But you've got...  You've got big beautiful eyes... Yes you do... and a... and a big round belly.  Big baby butt! I like big butts.  I like big butts and I cannot lie / you other brothers can't deny / when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist / and a round thing in your face you get... Oh my God, Emma... you're laughing! Oh my God, you've never done that before, have you? You never done that before... Daddy made you laugh, huh? Well, daddy and Sir Mix Alot... What? What? You... you wanna hear some more? Uhm... My anaconda don't want none / unless you got buns hon...  I'm a terrible father!  _B_ 
 Yeah. Hey! Here's an idea. Why don't we use our wedding china today? |5| Hey Hon? Would you help me get the plates down? 
 Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs. |4| Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...  "gay as the day is long"? 
 Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly.  No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this?  Oh.  Well, so what does that mean?  Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks.   |1|  It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.  
 Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work! |6| Hi honey! 
 You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired. |1| Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...?  
 How did the job stuff go? |3| Previously on Friends... 
 Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.  |7| Man, I sure miss Julie. 
 Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes. |3| Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking. 
  See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed. Opening Credits _B_ |5|  WHOAA!! 
 You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom... |7|  Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting! 
 I will have one.   |5| Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies? 
 Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress. |5|  Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes? 
 This is the New York Times. |9| Can I see the comics? 
 Or... Dick. |9| Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck. 
   Hi there.  |9|  Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldnt go out with a guy like Chandler... 
 Oh no-no-no, Im, Im paddling away! |4| Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.  
 Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesnt say cool anymore. |1| Hey! New wallet, huh? 
  Hey, its me. I know you cant stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought Id try and apologize over the phone. All I    |1|  Hello. 
 Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum. |6| Hey! 
 That's a pig. |8| No, look.  
  We're very happy for you. |9| All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey! 
 Hey man, what's up? |6| Oh, yeah, good idea.  
  Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I? |6| I'm fine, thanks. 
 First of the month. |5| Right! And when is that due? 
 Any contact? |3| She barely knows me. We just live in the same building. 
 No, I dont want to tell anybody else because I dont want Monica to find out. |1| Now, have you told anyone else? 
 So, what do you think? |4| Hey! 
 Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!! |0| Whats the matter? 
 Its Phoebe! Hi!  |9| Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?  
 betrothed couple. |8| Betrothed  
 Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake. |4|  Hi. 
 So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that were trying to get to play at the wedding? |5| Food? Uh-huh gimme!  
 Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the mrs. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain. |7| Why?! Whats happening to the coffee house?!  Oh!  
  Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama |1| Yeah I am! 
 Honey, you're screaming. |5|  I LOVE MY NEW JOB! 
 What? Why? |1| Dude, come home! 
 I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron. |0| I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money? 
 Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often. |6| Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night. 
 Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. Okay, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive? |0| So, how was the party? 
 Hey. |8| Hey. 
 The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put. |6| What? 
 Why? |4| Nothin' roomie, just watchin' you sleep. 
 Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster... |6| Oh, I ordered mine first. 
 Okay, Im not gonna have one. |2| I will have one.   
 Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing? |2| What? 
 Oh, great. This is just...  Opening Credits _B_ |4| Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go.  OK, thank you very much. _B_ 
 Tell it again.  Seriously. _B_ |4| All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I dont know, we were, we were making out. 
 You dont turn and slide, you throw it out! Im tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed! |0| How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide. 
 It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean its bad enough that Im in love with my roommates girlfriendwhich by the way, I think she knows. Because every time were in the room together theres this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when Ive seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, shes smooth! Smooth!   |1| Y'know if we ever go to war and youre captured, youre in for a big surprise. 
 Our eyes are closed and were about to cross the street. Very good. |8| Come on, no peeking!  
 I know!!  |4| People can hear you. 
 Thats a mailman! Thats our mailman!   Hi. How are ya? |9| Chandler, theres a guy right over there.  
 Treegers snaking the shower drain. Mr. |3|  What is that? 
 Uhh, 9.  |6| Monica? What time is it? 
 Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour? |1| Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it. 
 It's your timer.  |8| That was a half an hour? 
 Oh, I'm going on the lamb. |3| What are you doing?! 
 Oh yes. |7| All right now, memorize it.  You got it? 
 Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George. |4| Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion? 
 Rachel, wait, wait. |6| You have no respect for anybody's privacy! 
 What? |4| When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didnt get the annulment; we are still married. 
 So, is Janine around? |3| Sure, neighbor come on in. 
 Oh! Thats great, they havent seen the place since I moved in! _B_ |5|  I miss Rachel.  No, my parents. 
  Oh, well thank you in advance.  |9| And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift." 
 Okay, well tonights the big night. |7| Yeah, you didnt get one. 
 Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.  |6| Uh-huh! 
 I figured Id buy those. Pat, Id like to buy a vow.  |6| Theres still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet? 
 Yknow uh, I didnt actually do this. |5| Oh my God! You cleaned!  Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works! 
 Oh my God! |4| Yes! Now, theyre a little more than I normally spend on boots or rent  
 Pheebs you didnt have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang |9| I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here! 
 How come? |3| Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments? 
 Honey, she keeps cancelling on us...Take the hint! |4| No, I think we should save our china for something really special...Like, if the Queen of England comes over. 
  Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa. |4|  Uh-huh. 
 Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day. |6| But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.  
 Doctor Connelly just called. |3| Hey sweetie. 
 You're on!  |5| I'll put a pillowcase over my head. 
 Relax! We'll just get her some antacids. |1| Oh my God! 
 Relax! We'll just get her some antacids. |1| Oh my God! 
 I broke up with her. |2| So how was Joan? 
 No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned. |0| You ever figure out what that thing's for? 
 Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever. |0| Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you? 
 Believe me, sometimes that happens. MRS |3| If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink. 
 Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight. |3| Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her? 
 Sweet mother of all that is good and pure. |9| Alright open your eyes. _B_ 
 We can? All right, I'm tryin' that. |9| Come on! You guys can pee standing up. 
 If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best. |3| Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct? 
 I like her. |6| Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before. 
 Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?! |6|  Huh?! 
 Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world. |9| Hey what are you guys looking at? 
 Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but Im    |3|  Hello. 
 Wow! She looks great. Doesnt she? |8| I know!!  
 All right. |5|  Ha-ha.  No, its just Im so pregnant that Imy guitar doesnt fit anymore. So I thought til Im not, Im just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool! 
 Hey!  |8| I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.  
 We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know |2| What's the matter?! 
 And we're done with the chicken fried rice. |7| Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt. 
 Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red? |6| What are you guys doing up? 
 Okay.  |5| No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea. 
 No, just the months you actually want to live here. |3| And thats every month? 
 Im good. |9| Joey we know you steal our food.  
 Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe. |3|  Hey! So, whats with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong? 
 Well, its because I trust you, youre one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures. |4| You told me. 
 What are you guys doing? |8| Oh Willies still alive! 
 No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes. |5| What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year? 
 Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here? |2| Hi. Okay, will that be all? 
 Hey! Rachel and |9|  Hey! 
  It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us. |1| Oh, yknow I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. IWow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?  
  Monica said wedding. |2| Yeah, its just yknow 
 Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands! |6| Since when are you into swing music? 
 The young hot ball and chain. |5| Old? 
  Hi! Were checking out of the bridal suite. |8| No.  I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!  
 Are you, are you high? |7|  Hi. 
 Look, I cant. Whats going on? |2| Come home! 
 Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays. |1| I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in. 
 You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite!  Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer. |8|  You too. 
 Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year. |4| We need to talk to you about something. 
 So, where's Mike? |0| Oh! 
 You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.  |3| Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away. 
 You know, it's...  something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.  |2| I guess so.  
 You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody. |3| Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants. 
 Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight? |7| No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everything. 
 Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. _B_ You used my toothbrush? |1| Yeah, so. 
 I can't sleep now. |0| Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh-heh, please. 
 No. |4| Give it to me. 
 All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday? |7|  It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her! 
 We are. Hes meeting us here. |7| Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game? 
 All right, how about we, how bout we sell it. |6| Look, were not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands! 
 You! |8| What is that noise? 
 Hey, you know who used to have nails like that? |6| Chandler, dont worry! This doesnt make you any less of a guy!  That does!  What am I sitting on?  I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off. 
 Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings. _B_ |9| God! Ooh! What is that smell? Its coming from the bathroom. Ooh!  
 Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. |5| Absolutely. 
 Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!  |9| Well, they're not mine! 
 All right, then massage me up right nice!  |7| Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages! 
 And, we're done with the yogurt.  |9| Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.  
  Yes.  |6|  Is that your card?  
 Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 1130 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.  Delivery |0| Wow! How'd you get in there? 
 Hiya doin' pumpkin? |9| Okay.  
 Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard! |5| Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend! 
 Can I just say one thing? |4| No, you wait! This is ridiculous! 
 Can I check out what she did to my room? |2| Uh, no, shes at dance class. 
  Why cant I tell them that we live together? |5| Yeah, and yknow, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four. _B_ 
 That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up. |5|  Here, check it out. Its the first one, too.  
 Monica and I are engaged. |8| Whats up? 
  Shes not as pretty as she was when she was 29. |1|  Hey. 
 Right. So uh, have you written yours yet? |3| Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding. 
 No, it wasnt you. |5| Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again? 
 Im gonna miss being able to afford food. |1| I know. 
 Hey! |8| Hey! 
 Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers?  Who said that? |9| Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners. 
 Hey. |8|  Hey! 
  Oh, that's great. |7| twice as big as Allessandro's. 
 What is the point of having them, if we never use them? |2| What if something gets broken? They're so expensive! 
 Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop. |1| I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind. 
 Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie!  I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go . |4|  Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge. 
  Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work! |2| As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die.  So, excuse me for being a little skittish. 
 Actually it's both of us. |3| With good news?  Of course it is not good news, you just said  "Doctor Connelly just called". If it was good news you would have said  "Doctor Connelly just called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you? 
 That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross! |7| Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?! 
 That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross! |7| Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?! 
  Seriously, answer faster! |5|  Sex! 
 Oh my God! _B_ |4| She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor! 
 Oh my God! _B_ |4| She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor! 
 They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them. |8| Dont tell me, because of the big nostril thing? 
 Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad. |5| Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year? 
 Congratulations! |9| Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option. 
 All right Ill have one.  |5| No, no, its just my tooth. 
 Well, thats pretty much all Im looking for from these people. |4|  Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time? 
 Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one. |2|  Oh, no-no, no-no-no, theres none of that in here. 
 Was it like a sneeze only better? |3| Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something. 
 Could we be more white trash? Opening Credits _B_ |1| Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!  
 Hey! |8| Maybe he found you flip-flop.  
 What?! |3| Emily's cousin kicked me out! 
 Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!! |9| All right, then massage me up right nice!  
 Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later.  Hey, how about maroon? |4|  Dark red. 
 Oh my God! |4| Whoa! 
 Okay, here is the phone bill.  |1| Ahhh. 
 I see where youre goin! |6| Yknow whats more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Yknow whats even more generous than that?!! 
 Me too.  |9| Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadnt been on the toilet. 
 It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. Im going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast Im just gonna propose. |7| Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her? 
 Whats the matter honey? |3|  Oww! 
 Are you kidding? Okay, Ill give you a hint; Ill give you a hint.  |3| What? 
 Its your mommy. Its your mommy. |7|  Hello?  Hold on please. Joey, its your mom.  
 Oooh, Im afraid that does not exist. |2| Oh, my mom called, theyre gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so were looking for a good picture of us. 
 Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen . |5| What? That's like insanely easy! 
 Okay. Okay. |1| No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, its all yours.  
 Ino! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box. |0| Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs.  Thief. 
  Thats a plane! |4|  There it is! Oh, look at that! Isnt Mother Nature amazing? 
 Gap commercial.  So did you book them? Did you call? |1| Chandler. 
 And Im the happiest guy in the world!  Oh honey, come on dont be upset. We still have so much to look forward to! |5|  Thats right. Im no longer a bride. Ill never be a bride again. Now, Im just someones wife! 
 Id better go pack. |5| Yeah! Have a great honeymoon! 
 Really? I dont like baths. |9| I just had the most amazing bath. 
 I feel violated. And not in a good way. |0| Oh, that is so sick. 
 _B_ No! |2| I dont know how to tell you this, but I think that Monicas cheating on ya! I told you that you shouldnt have married someone much hotter than you! _B_ Right, look. If you cant come home and deal with this, then I'm gonna 
 Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired. |0| You're really not coming back? 
 You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer? |6| Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold. 
 Pirates again? |6| Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients. 
 Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's. |6| I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars. 
 Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft.   |1| Pardon? 
 What? |4| Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did? 
 Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere. |2| Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain. 
 No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now. |1| You want me to sing? 
 Ok, you can have it. _B_ |7| Give it to me. 
 I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist. |7| Why? 
 Ye-e-es!! |9| No! Rachel, thats what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I dont get through, theyre not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! Its us versus them! 
  Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet?  They seem all right with it! Opening Credits _B_ |2| All right. But, youre gonna have to tell them.  
 The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. |1| Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 
 Sorry.  |0| Sorry. 
 See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's! |4| Yeah, they're mine. 
 Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica. |8|  Hey, what's-what's going on?! 
 Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut. |6| Hi Chandler! 
 Okay, so Richard, Richard! |0| Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice! 
 That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas. |9| What? What?! 
  Oh my God. What is th its like a guy never lived in here. Look, youve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous.  Its spreading already. |1| Yeah, but, hey look, dont go through her stuff. She gets really mad. 
 Why havent you told them?! |0| Because they dont know were dating.  Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?  
 I dunno what it is, it just doesnt quite feel like Christmas to me. |1| That is nice and were done. TADA!  
 I made that joke up. |6| What? 
  Is that a swing? |3| Yeah. And yknow who shouldve shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over. 
 A hot girls at stake and all of the sudden hes Rain Man. |4| Oh, cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, theres your admirer.  
 Ill give up my ticket. |3| No! No! Its just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us! 
 Thanks. |9| Oh my God.  Congratulations. 
 Pheebs? |9| Haaaa...  ... ahhhh! 
 Do you think you could get through a poem? |1| Oh! I would love to read a poem. 
 Do you happen to know what Im going to say? |4| No! But I know exactly what Im going to say. 
 Oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh.  _B_ |3| Uh, oh-oh, umm no you didnt. I did. 
 I got a maid. Yay! |7| Well then who? 
 She had a point.  |2| Im sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, "Oh, these are way too expensive for you." 
  Awesome. |9| Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean. 
 Do you have any ideas? |0| Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank.  I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots! 
 I will explain it to her. |5| Ok..but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over... 
 Oh, you'll see my friend. _B_ |8| What are you doing? 
 Ok, here we go!  |7| Oh, play them! 
 Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment. |9| What? 
  So, Zack's pretty nice, uh? |1| Thanks. 
  It's like a giant hug. |3| Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"! 
 Or facing a bitch of a commute. |4| So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris? 
 We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle? |5|  What are you guys doing? 
 I'm tellin' you, she leaned back; I could see her brain. |2| Come on, they were not that huge. 
 Can I uh see something?  |2| There's my little boy.  
 Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time. |4| Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you. 
 And twenty-five it is. |9| Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies. 
 Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen. |6| I know. 
 So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night! |4| Multiple orgasms! Opening Credits _B_ 
 Hey. |8| Hey. 
  Ross, ten o'clock. |9| Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do? 
 Okay.  |5| Okay, but only if you give me a drag. 
 Where did you, when did you, how did you...  How did you get a girl like that? |4| Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her? 
 Oh, yeah! How did you meet her? |7| Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.  
 Well the vet seems to think thats shes becoming a rooster.  Were getting a second opinion. Opening Credits _B_ |7| What kind of changes? 
 Do we pay for this? |1| Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I mustve hit something on the remote. 
 I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time. |3| I'm really getting tired of sneaking around. 
 It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it! |4| It's so good, isn't it? 
 Hi there! |9| Hi! 
 Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage? |2| Okay, maybe it wasnt my best decision. But I just couldnt face another failed marriage. 
 Thats our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why dont I justwhy dont I just cover you for a while? |1|  Oh my God!! 
 Thats great! |9| You serious?! 
 Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third... |0| Hey.  
 Hey!! |7|  Hey guys! 
 Hey. |8| Hey.  
 I got glasses! |4| Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandlers eyes! 
 No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy whos going like this  |7| Thats not true, there are great pictures of us! 
 Can we start over? |4| Right, yeah, cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute. 
 Because it's too delicious. |2| Why, why not? 
 Do you want me to call? |3| I will. 
 We got the honeymoon. |5| Oh yeah, right.  
 A Speedo? Uh, I dont have a Speedo. Im gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.  |4| Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldnt find though was your Speedo.  
 Honey, its not the bath I enjoy, its the wet, naked lady. |5| Wait, you like them with me. 
 I dont see him.  Do you see him? |3| Is Joey here? 
 I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games... |6| How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots! Opening Credits _B_ 
 _B_ Can you hear him now? |6| I just heard him! 
 So, who does?  |4| It's so unfair, you don't even like your job! 
 No! We're not borrowing money. |0| Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents. 
 Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us. |3| Are you kidding? 
 A dinosaur died a million years ago? |3| Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...!  Guess what happened at work today... 
 Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars. |0| Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back. 
  Bob here. Opening Credits _B_ |2| I got a little drunk...and naked. 
 Oh, she's goin' somewhere. |3| Because she's your lobster. 
 Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning. |0| Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap? 
 Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you. |4| Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man. 
 That was there when I got here. _B_ |2| _B_ There you go, enjoy your coffee. 
 See that is the problem with invisible dentists. |1| No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I cant see him. 
 Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie? |5| Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks. 
  Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965. |9|  Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this!  Thats my Moms writing! Look. 
  Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that? |2| Great!  
  Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww! |7| What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything  Opening Credits _B_ 
 Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?! Kathy's Co-|2| That is one good looking man! 
 Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass! |7| That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel? 
 How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease? |1| Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back. 
 Or we can do the actual telephone thing. Opening Credits _B_ |2| Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string! 
 Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting. |2| Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy. 
 Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!  |6| Okay! Okay! Okay!   
  Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch? |4|  It is'? 
 Why havent you told them?! Wouldnt they be happy?! |0| Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didnt. 
 See now it feels like Christmas! Opening Credits _B_ |4| Oh, here.  
 Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke hed ever heard. |5| Uh, oh-oh, no you didnt. I did. 
 Yuck! |1| Oh dont even ask! 
 Yeah. |6| That sounds perfect! 
 Skull? |1| Huh? 
   Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! Whats wrong with me? Ooh, dont open that door. Opening Credits _B_ |0|  Lets just do it right now. Okay? It wont be hard. Just say whats in your heart.  
 Uh honey, I know you dont like to relinquish control |4|  I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then 
 Oh, okay. |6| Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom. 
 Hi! |9| N No! We took a cab too, but I did test runs!  
 Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. |2| Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'. 
  And so young. |7|  I'm dead? 
 It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.  It means... |5| Oh... what does that mean? 
  Thanks Joey, that's a good idea. |9| Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you. 
 So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his! |3| Yeah, I guess. 
  What've you been up to? |6|  Bob here. Opening Credits _B_ 
 So uh, which one is mine? |3| Uh-huh. 
 Not a one. |1| No plans, huh? 
 No, ten o'clock. |5| Is it? Feels like two. 
 Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute? |5| Well, actually Gunther sent me. Youre not allowed to have cups out here, its a thing.  _B_ 
  Yeah? Opening Credits _B_ |6|  Eh, do you believe that? 
 Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre. |4| Well, I never call me. _B_ 
 No-no, why dont you hang on to that one.  |3| Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit.  
  Hey. |8|  Oh my.  Opening Credits _B_ 
 Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty. |5| Yeah, whatever.   
 Maybe we shouldnt pay our phone billfree phone sex. |0| No, we didnt even pay our cable billmaybe this is how they punish us. 
 Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing. |8| All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked. 
 Good-bye muscles!! Opening Credits _B_ |9| Say good-bye to sore muscles! 
 Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her. |1|  I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this! 
 Its not charity, Joe |7| No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity anymore. 
 Oh, is that against the rules? |3| Its a girl! Anyway, it wouit wouldnt matter. Okay? Because Im a teacher and shes a student. 
 Oh thats right. Its your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick? |6|  Oh my God! Its Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!  
 And I think Ross is generous too. |9| Okay thats so generous! 
 Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you. Mrs. |7| Chandler. 
 Oh all right. |3| Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse? 
 No I didnt! |4| Well, you-youve always had glasses. 
 I dont know what it is, I just cant take a good picture. |4| Oh my God! Thats the creep that youre with at the Statue of Liberty. 
 Oh, okay, time's up! |2| Nobody cares about the Dakotas.  _B_ 
 No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate,  Mommas Little Bakery.  I feel terrible, Im a horrible, horrible, horrible person. |0| Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong. 
  Monica, there are no words  There are no words! This should not be this hard! |4|   Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! Whats wrong with me? Ooh, dont open that door. Opening Credits _B_ 
 The wedding pictures? |2| Thats not til Thursday. 
 Theyre terrific, and they live right here in the city. |8| No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too! 
 Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth. |3| Oh, baths are so relaxing! 
 Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?  It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem?  I'm right, right? Joey and |3| So have you called her yet? 
 _B_ No! Wait! |0| No. Right, Im going in! 
 Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money. |3| Why not? 
 You have to pick your moments.  |7| What, it's ok when Chandler does it? 
 No, no! We made this decision together. |1|  That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking! 
 ... And where's this money coming from?  |0| I will, really. I'll pay you back this time. 
  You or me? |6| Hold it, hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts. 
 All right, Okay, all right. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home. |2| C'mon. Let her. Yeah. 
 Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem. OPENING TITLES _B_ _B_ |1| Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it. 
 Hey, you feelin' better? |6| C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . . _B_ 
 Hey. MONICA and |9| Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash. OPENING TITLES _B_ 
 God that is good TV. OPENING TITLES _B_ |7| Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed. 
 I didn't realize that. |7| No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh? 
 Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something. |1| Well Ross was hangin out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler.... 
 Okay, thats like the least fun game ever. |1| No-no, why dont you hang on to that one.  
 No!! |2| Whoa!!! 
 Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era. |5| Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era. 
 Goin out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer. |5| That would be Casey. Were going out tonight. 
 You dont have to stop having fun just because Im here. Kathy didnt cheat on all of you.  Well, except you.  |3| Great!  
 That's sweet, Joey. |8| That's very nice. 
 Yeah! |8| Well, get 'em out of here! What's wrong with you? 
 I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I justI didn't know what it was! |0| Good-bye muscles!! Opening Credits _B_ 
 Oh, okay.  Here you go.  |6| It's uh, 27 dollars even. 
 What? |4| Oh God, here we go! 
  Hey! |8| That's it! Thanks Pheebs! _B_ 
  Is that your tiny little box, thats too small to put anything in? |1| No. 
 Why wouldnt they be happy? |2|  So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! Ill see you then.  
 That was like 5 years ago. |4| I cant believe Ross went out with Rachels sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years. 
 Im not gonna mess it up. |1| Youre gonna mess it up let me do it. 
  Already?! |4| Okay!  
 Staying out of the way. |6| What is your job? 
 Youre an actor! |6| No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone youre not 
 Look, shes really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges. |1| Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose! 
 I kinda like it here. |4| All right.  
 Muskogee? That's like four hours from Tulsa! WOO HOO! Narrator from |4| And next up is a marching band from Muskogee, Oklahoma. 
 Well, how you died was funny. |3| Posting that I died? That really isn't funny. 
 This is..shhh! Second |6| "Hey Chandler, it's Charlie" 
  It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us. |2| Chandler? 
 Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused.  It's a whole big boob story. |6| What... I could, I could do it. What is it? 
 Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"! |9|  Excuse me? 
 He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps. |3| Sounds like he's with someone. 
 What did I marry into? |3| Or "Win, Lose or Draw". 
 My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.  |1| I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want. 
 Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her. |6| Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.  
 Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies? |0| I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick. 
 _B_ Ohh yes. |6| Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. _B_ Not that one. 
 Oh, right, right, shut up. |2| Not even, say, breaking up with Janice? 
 Phoebs, play with meeee. |4| God that is good TV. OPENING TITLES _B_ 
 Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns. OPENING TITLES _B_ |7| Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See _B_ honk honk. 
  There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock! |8| What? 
 You're flingin'-flangin' right I am! |6|  Are you intrigued? 
 All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list. |6| No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox. 
  Dont look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel! |9| Booo!! 
 That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienists blouse. |3| Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies. 
  It must take you forever to find your keys. |8|  Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses! 
 She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot! |7|  Hi Mom, it's Jill. 
 Oh, so thats why the priest threw holy water on me.  Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate. |1| Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan. 
 I could die. |3| Just go up to her and ask her out.  Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen? 
 They couldnt be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me. |0| So are things with you and Joey any better? 
 Were you so late because you were burring this woman? |1| Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so shed have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy. 
 Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.  |8| Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey! 
 Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair! |6| Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya! 
  Hello, Chandler Bing. |9| Ohh, no, no. Were not going to just sit.  Shhh.  
 Hey! |8|  Hey! Dont you give me any of yourHey!  
 Okay uh, heres the electric bill.  |8| No! Forget it! OkayI mean thanks, but Im done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, whats next? Come on. 
 I think it's winning. |5| Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg." 
 I see. |7| No, but it is frowned upon. 
 Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really.  Nothing. _B_ |1| Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day. 
 That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV. |2| It wasnt the best. 
 Yeah, Im not in that. |0|  Oh, heres a great one. 
 Oh that's not bad, Pheebs? |4| All right, I got 48. 
 Too? |6| Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too. 
 Whats up? |6|  Yknow what? Actually Im kinda glad theyre leaving cause uh, I need to talk to you about something. 
 Not the disposable cameras from the tables. |3| They wont be ready for weeks. 
 Im sorry, were just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with. |2| Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call. 
 You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again? |2|  Give me that!  
 Yeah well, too bad were gonna have to return them. |2| Theyre mine! 
 Honey, its 200 on a Wednesday and Im watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am? |5| How dirty do you think I am? Im telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away. 
 And you wonder why Ross is their favorite? |8| Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and its always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year Im going to make them cry. 
 If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.  |2| Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time. 
 Right. Just stay there. I'm coming home. |5| I heard him again! _B_ 
 Well, that's what we said about Joey... |1| What? It's, it's just a phase. 
 That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard. Opening Credits _B_ |6| Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride. 
 No way! |4| Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok. _B_ 
 Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding? |2| Carol? 
 Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet.  Joey, she does not look fat. Opening Credits _B_ |0| What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then? 
 Okay, let's do it.  What? |2| Your boobs are fine. look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here.  Oh, can't make.... hands... meet.... Opening Credits _B_ 
 Rhythm? |6| Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got. 
 GET OUT NOW!! |7| Yeah. 
 Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket. |0| Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out. 
 No, no, no, I dont, I dont really wanna play. |0| Great, you can cover Chandler. 
 Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand. |8| Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand. 
 Oh.  Nope, that patch is no good.  |2| Well, Im really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.  
 Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!!  Huh. |0| Come on you guys, it's no big deal!  
  What? |4| No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey. 
 What are you writing? |4| Oh, wait-wait!  Maybe its a pickle?!  Opening Credits _B_ 
 Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on! Mr. |1|  Whoa, hey, that ladys all kinds of naked. 
 Wouldnt that be Frank the III? |4|  No. No. No.  Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR. 
 Hello! |7| Hey! 
 Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth. |4| Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her. 
 Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first. |4| Hey, where's the chicken? 
  Is that Joey?!  Let me talk to him! _B_ |1|  Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler? 
 Ross, just for my own piece of mind, youre not married to anymore of us are ya? Opening Credits _B_ |6| Another lie. You have a sickness! 
 No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, youre going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff. |1| No. 
 What? What? Why?! |0| Well, um, because mainly, um, they dont like you. Im sorry. 
 Hey Joe whats up? |9| Hey you guys. 
 So you kissed her, so what happened after that? |3| Oh we kissed it up real nice. 
 Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right? |5| Im sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.  
 Joey |7| Yeah you got 5 years left! 
  Ah, finally an explanation. |6| Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time! 
 Oh well, we dont because we got the other pl-place.  |3| Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go. 
 Shes not gonna say no. |2| If she says no, can I have the ring? 
 Oh, I got some thoughts on that. |1| Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music 
 So |6| All right, I should get going, big day at work. Yknow Im in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out Im not brain dead. 
 Im so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You shouldve seen her. Writing, writing, writing! _B_ |1| Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise. 
 Yes, I distinctly remember cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay? |1| Did she really say that? 
 Im so sorry. |0| Oh my God, this is horrible! 
 I'm sorry I won't be here. |2| I can't get *enough* dinosaurs! 
 Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. |5| Yeah. Cushions the blow. 
 It kills over one americans every year. |4| Oh please, hit by a blimp? 
 I'm sorry. |0|  Oh my God! 
 Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day. |3| I could be a secretary. 
 No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out. |3| Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"! 
  I'm back. |4| I know. 
 _B_ Do we dare? |4| _B_ Ohh yeah, that's the stuff. 
 No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note. |1| Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it. 
 Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time. |5| No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation. 
 Morning. |7| Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call. _B_ 
 She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men! |8| Oh. Hel-lo! 
 Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one cant get mad. |7| Her what? 
 Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule. |2|  Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule. 
 How can she be great if shes from Poughkeepsie?  That joke wouldve killed in Albany. |8| No, Im getting back down cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but shes like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away. 
 Are you aware that you're still talking? |9| I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there? 
  Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me!  Its been six months! Its not funny! |1|  Hello Mr. Bing...I love you. 
 Pheebs, I dont understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about? |6| Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute? 
 Uh, yeah.  |3| This is how much we pay for electric?!!! 
 She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.  |8| I think it's insane. 
  So uh, whats this thing youre auditioning for? |1|  Fine! Ill do it without you!  I dont need you or anybody else! Im gonna make it on my own!  Youll see!! Youll all see!! Opening Credits _B_ 
 Hey! |8| Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...  
  Okay, you get her in here.  You bolt the door. Ill be in the closet. Opening Credits _B_ |4| Im getting married!!!! Im gonna be a bride!!!!  No, I will not shut up because Im engaged!  Ohh, big talk! Huh, why dont you come over here and say that to me?! Huh, buddy?! Yeah, my fiancée will kick your ass!  Come on, apartment 20! Apartment 20! _B_ 
 That sounds like my first bike.  My dad gave me his old one. |6| Well, we didnt have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on. 
 Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. Im buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night. |4| Well this uh, this may be a little awkward. 
 Ill tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home. |4| Thats true!  I knew I married you for a reason! 
 Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing? |0| I don't know. 
 Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk? |5|  Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you. 
 Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R? |2| Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus yknow the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I dont know, gal pal Rachel Green? 
 Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine. |7| Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney! 
 Yea yea.  |7|  So sexy.  Honey. 
 Aren't you one of the stars of popular daytime soap Days of our Lives? |8| Oh my god!! 
 Is that really necessary? |3| Great. Ill see you when you get here. Im gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out. 
 Oh hey Monica.  |8|  Here you go.  
 And we're changing.  _B_ _B_ |6| Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before. 
 Yes please. |7| Ok, you really want me out? 
 Well, it's official there are no good movies. |1|  Wow, it is easy.  Now, I can have milk everyday.  Opening Credits _B_ 
 What a wank! |0|  Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. Im so depressed Im going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! Im going medieval on prices! 
 Thats not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Dont say that I dont have goals! |5| Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up. 
 I was shrieking... like a Marine.  |1| Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand. 
 Hey. |8|  Hey! 
 I tell people secrets. It makes them like me. |6| Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.  
 Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper? |6| Fine by me; hope she wins. Opening Credits _B_ 
 Wait! Youre going out with Kathy! |9| Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!  
 I dont know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.  |4|  Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out!  Guess which job I got. 
 Oh yeah?  Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you  never go out of stylewhat did you throw away?  |4| Well, Joshuas coming in tomorrow and since I dont have the guts to ask him out, Im going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket. 
 Like finding money with naked people on it! Mr. |5| Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money. 
 Might wanna open with the snowman.  |2| So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman. 
 Okay, bye!  |6|  Great. I'll see you later! 
 So, well do the rest of the bills later then? Opening Credits _B_ |3| Uh, yeah.  
 Yes talk to her. Be a man. |6|  All right, youre right. Ill talk to her. 
 Is this why they dont like me or why you dont like me? |1| Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that youre really sarcastic, or that, yknow, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch. 
 I can see why thats hard to resist. |6| I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Yknow, everywhere I look shes like  
 So shes just waiting over there for ya?  Opening Credits _B_ |7| I came over here to tell you guys. 
 Seriously? |2| No. 
 Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.  |6| Do you guys know any cute guys? 
 No! |2| Yes! 
 Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in vegetables, Joey? |9| regular celery. 
 All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister. |4| Ive never done that.  
 Whats the matter? |4| Fine, I can do it.  Whew. 
 I have you. |6| Honey, Im not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but Im going to wear them all the time. Youll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it? 
 He pulled a quarter out of my ear! |1| Where’s my granddaughter? I’ve been practicing my magic tricks. 
 Good morning everyone, it's nice to see our team togetherfor the first time. Now, before we get started, are there anyquestions?  Yes, Ken is it? |9| Oh, dear god! *Opening Credits* _B_ 
  Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica! |6|  Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard! 
 Thanks.  I'll see you new year's day. |9| It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand. 
 You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West! |2| Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here. 
 Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out. |9| I'm sorry too.  
 I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go! |2| Chandler! 
 Tonight?!  Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond?  Oh, there it is! |0| So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight.  
 Tonight?!  Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond?  Oh, there it is! |0| So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight.  
 Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish? |6| So, are we gonna get together or what? 
 Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball. |9| Why don't you play with your roommate? 
 Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that. |5| Morning, hey, you made pancakes? 
 Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.' |0| Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone. 
 Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.  _B_ |1|  I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy. 
 Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesnt try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts. |5| Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first youre really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow. 
 Whos number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play. |6| Really? Whos number two? 
 Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday. |8| Just pickle. 
 Hey, look at this!  Theyre lighting the big Christmas tree tonight. |2| Done! I did it! Heh, whos stupid now?  Opening Credits _B_ 
 Hi guys! |9| Oh yeah?  Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you  never go out of stylewhat did you throw away?  
 Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!  |5| But, I love you. 
 That. Opening Credits _B_ |5| I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?! 
 Yes! Well that-yes. |9| Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isnt that why you guys are here? 
 No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg. Opening Credits _B_ |3| Think it'll work? 
 Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay. |0| Id bet Id still be doing my kara-tay.  Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from yknow, not doing anything else physical. 
 Are you judging them by their covers? Because youre really not supposed to do that. |0|  Ill be waiting. Opening Credits _B_ 
 Its okay, I want this to be your night too.  To Monica. |6| Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh!  Okay, umm, I just wanna say that I love you guys so-so much and-and thank you for being here on my special night.  Our special night. I mean it just wouldnt be myour-our night, if you all werent here to celebrate with meusDamnit! 
 Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.  |7| Sorry, Im kinda keeping this one on the Q.T. 
 But youre still my friend? |8| No, its Its not that. Umm, now what Im going to say to you, Im not saying as your friend. Okay? Im-Im saying as it as Monicas older brother. 
 What? What did you take a picture of? |2| Okay.  
 ...little playthings with yarn? |5| No, it's not just that. It's justI want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...  
 Well what did it do? |4| Well I-I really dont remember the name of it. 
 Oh my God, whats up?! |2| Well, neither. 
 What?! No! No! |0| Sure. 
 No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up. |2| Her answer machine? 
 No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office  Am I producing them? |2| Honey why don’t you go lie down. 
 Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren? |5| Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work. 
 She's cheating on Joey with Ross! |5| Oh my God, that's Charlie! 
 Maureen Rosilla. |5| You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason. 
  No. |4| C'mon give me five more. Five more. 
 Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her. |0| You know, if you want, I'll do it with you. 
 I want you out. |4| Ok, then I want to hear you say it, I, I want to hear you say you want me out. 
 Because the kids need new shoes. |8| Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place? 
 Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit. |0| So, Chandler, whos on your list? 
 Yeah, all right, Ill play. |5| Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe itll take your mind off Janice, and if you dont play, everyone will be mad at you cause the teams wont be even. Come on. 
  All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. Id like know whether thats several big fish or just one big fish. |4| I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm.... 
 No way! |4|  Im gonna be on TV!! 
 No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a |0| Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple? 
 Hey!  |8|  Oh. 
 Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago. |3| Oo! Is it for my birthday present? 
 Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.  |1| Yeah. Why are you getting so upset? 
 Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back. |4| What? 
 Oh, I can uh, check that for ya. |6| Oh, theyre just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick. 
  Hello! |7| Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it? 
 I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference. |2| Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont. 
  And the bunny got away.  |9| Sorry. 
 What? |4| What the hell was that?! 
 No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldnt take it. |0| So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment? 
 Defend yourself. |6| Im a man. 
 Yknow, itll be okay. Itll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then well tell em. |5| Look, I know that I shouldve told them. I know I shouldnt care what they think. Im sorry. 
 Hey! |8| Hey!  
 What in Gods name is that?! |2|  Okay!  
 Really? |5| Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy. 
 Theyre twins! |9| Im sayin I see a difference. 
  No, Im not! |3| Okay, weve been out here for two hours and we havent seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandlers getting chilly.  
 Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance |8| Oh, Greg and Jenny yuck!  Hi Greg, Im Chandler this is Monica. Hi Monica, this is Jenny. Hi Jenny. Hi Greg. 
 Her what?!! |0| Oh my God!!! Monica!! Hes the stripper from your bachelorette party!! 
 Hey Pheebs, whats up? |9|  No.  
 Oh!  Shes growing inside you. |8| Oh-oh! Okay, shes kicking! 
 What are you doing? |8| Are you kidding me? Watch!  Well I cant do it with you guys watching me! Opening Credits _B_ 
 Man, if only youd gotten here sooner.  |5| Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately we cant guarantee a private room and currently theyre all unavailable. 
  Well, don't believe everything you hear, Ken. But yeah, that's true. Alright, let'sget started, by take a look at last quarter's figures.  Ah, Claudia, aren'tyou supposed to blow smoke up the bosses' ass? |0| That's right. Is it true, that the reason you are here in Tulsais that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job withoutrealizing what you were saying yes to? 
 Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face. _B_ |2| My dad told me. They play golf together. 
 What are you going to do? |5| OH! Stupid long sleeves! 
 Did I not mention that? |1|  You're not gonna be here new year's eve' 
 "So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?" |9| What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi! Opening Credits _B_ 
 Ok! |7| I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor! 
  Nice!  |8| Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor. 
  Nice!  |8| Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor. 
 So, uh, how often can you do it? |3| Chandler? 
 Ok.  Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off. |1| Great, I'll see you then. 
 Ya know, the man's got a point. _B_ |5| Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them. 
 Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild. |4| I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up. 
 No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room. |0| Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy? 
 Well, how do you find clothes that fit? |3| Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing. 
 Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back. |1| Cause she uh, she steals stuff. 
 Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here. |1| Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it! 
 Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink. |1| My boss, Joanna? Wow, that mustve been awkward. 
 Hey. |8| Hey, hey. 
 All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I cant believe I missed it. |0| Umm, that papers two weeks old. 
 He thought you said gonad.  Opening Credits _B_ Health |6| What? 
 Sorry man. |1| What? Oh! 
  Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person. _B_ |1| Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes. 
 Yeah, I guess. |2| Look, Chandler, its my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they dont print the name, so it doesnt really matter who gets credit, right? 
 Sure I would! |4| And what if I was still fat?  Well, you wouldnt be dating me, thats for sure. 
 Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class. |5| Hey Chandler! Yknow that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director? 
 That is lucky. |1| Thats the title! Yeah! Yknow they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese. 
 To Monica!  |8| Awww, come onwaitstop it. Okay, to Monica. 
 Oh, whats at 800? |5| Okay.  
 Sure! Thats one of the great things about being engaged. Im not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore. The |8|  Well hello! Shes cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her? 
 During this time are you, are you still my best man? |9| Not for the next few minutes. 
 Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet? |4| Nothing! It was something. 
 Could you want her more? |8| What? 
 A vending machine? |3| Well, you justyou put a quarter in and yknow pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something. 
 Oh no-no, no you dont, just come back. |2| I dont know. Its-its just lately, Ive been feeling Okay, heres what it is  You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks!  
 Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o." |0| So, uh, why didn't you say anything? 
 Couldn’t sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn’t sleep. Y’know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I’ll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I’ll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn’t fall asleep. |2| Why’re you so tired? 
 Monica, can I talk to you for a sec?  |3|  Nice!  
 Monica, can I talk to you for a sec?  |3|  Nice!  
 Hey. |8| Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.  _B_ 
 Next time, can I say breathe? |7| Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good. 
 Next time, can I say breathe? |7| Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good. 
 Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay. |7| Guys, you got your hair cut. 
 One. . . two. . . two and a half. Okay, just show me one of them. _B_ |5| Five more and I'll flash you. 
 Where did you hear it from before? |4| No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips. 
 Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me. |4|  Good morning. 
 I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head. |5| Now, you do realize that shes a cartoon, and way out of your league? 
  Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night.  Where exactly were around ten-ish? |2| I know. I feel horrible. Okay. 
 Oh my God! Whos gonna watch that?! |4| Yeah! Theyre putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channels gonna film it! 
 Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter. |6|  Hey guys! What's...  
 Well, I have a call in about that. |1| Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet? 
 Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you. |5| What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive. 
 Well, you-you know what I meant. |7| But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black? 
  Oh no-no-no-no! |0| All right, yknow what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?  Joey and 
 Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.  That didn't happen, I made that up! |0| Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make! 
 No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me. |7| I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever. 
 The British are coming? |3| Hey you guys, guess what? 
  Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal! |7| I know...  
  Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?! |7| Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids 
 Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts? |8| Luck! 
 I was not flirting. |2| The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?! 
 Yeah, yeah! Me too! |9| Okay! 
 How much did I love The King and I?  |8|  Ross! Stop it! Come on! 
 We actually missed it. |7| Well! What happened?! Did we miss it? 
 I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, yknow? But I have to trick him into taking it so I wont hurt his pride. |5| Well, how much do you think he needs? 
 Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didnt I? |8| You really think thatll work? 
 You are aware that shes not a monkey, right? |7| I know. And shes so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair. 
 Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldnt you be at work? |4| Hey! 
 Hey! |8| Hi! 
 So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor. |3| What is it? 
  Give me it! |9|  Hi Monica.  
  You didnt think I used to wear glasses, right? |8| Yeah! 
 All right, but I should warn you, Im not going. Im going.  Opening Credits _B_ |1| Chandler what do you say? 
 You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things? |5| I dont care. Phoebes Phoebe. Ursulas... hot!  
 Because its flattering!  Come on Monica! Come on Monica!  |0| Then why are you wearing Monicas jacket? 
 Couldnt I just say, "This is Ross?" |9| Hey, yknow whats weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people youre gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." Thats weird isnt it? 
 What?! What are you talking about? |2| We found your test in the trash, if youre not pregnantIts because I am.  
 We really didnt get a chance to |4| Yknow what? Why dont you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here? 
 You had a bachelorette party?! |7| Your secret bachelorette party

 Lets.  Opening Credits _B_ |5|  Oh Phoebe, thats a great story. Can you tell it to me when youre getting me some iced tea?   Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!! 
 No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Rightnow, I can't remember why.  You're not allowed to smokein this office. Not right? |0| I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you? 
 Well, you proved them wrong. |5|  I guess I'm going to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there! The producer is going to be so mad at me...He sat us all down yesterday and said everyone has to be there six AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani!  Like I was some kind of idiot! 
  ...AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT!  --- Opening Credits --- _B_ |8| No! 
 Hey, that was really good! |7| "Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die." 
  Zack! |5| Uh! 
 I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica? |2| Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size. 
 I used to have that bumper sticker.  |3| Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys. 
 You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler! |8| Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie. 
 I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table. |7| Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "Hey, you're not Bob." 
  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore.  |0| One. . . two. . . two and a half. Okay, just show me one of them. _B_ 
 That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy. |9| What is that sparkly thing? 
 Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos? |5| I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos. 
 We don't need to remedy that. |7| Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we? 
 Thank you, buddy. |9| He could never get a woman like that in a million years. 
 Hey, man. What's up? |5| Hey. 
 Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately. |2| Hey, howd the date go with Mr. Millionaire? 
  No. No! |2|  You ah, you didnt say Yes to that did you? 
 All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice? |2|  But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes.  Pretty, huh?  
 And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup? |5| Hey. 
 Really?! I didnt think girls ever just wanted a fling. |5| Hey, yknow, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know itll be Valentines Day, then my birthday, then bang!before you know it, theyre lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody!  Yknow, I want a man!!  I mean, it doesnt even have to be a big relationship, yknow, just like a fling would be great. 
 Without me?! |4| Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum. 
 We dont know what could make this go away. |2|  Oh no-no-no-no! 
  All this lying has been hard on us too. |8| Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't 
 And you're gonna make them all disappear. |3| Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff. 
 Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursdays was just our thing man! Opening Credits _B_ |4| Yeah, yeah I think Im gonna find my own place.

  Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke. |0|  Hey guys. 
 What, you guys really think that Im that shallow? |2|  Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right! 
 And say nothing? |7| I dont know. I dont know. I cant lie to him again. Oh no Ino! Im just gonna press my breasts up against him. 
 Does South Oregon have a sports-team?  There you go. _B_ |6| Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports team! 
 Hey! What are you guys doing? |8| Not really, I got to drag him around too!  Opening Credits _B_ 
 No Rach, its not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasnt that much fun. _B_ |8| Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this? 
 Do I still call you Ross? |4| Nope. 
 Oh. |5| Are you joking? Check out is not til noon and he has a good  eleven minutes left. 
  Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening. |5| Who? 
 Do you? |6| All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but thats different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean? 
 Hey! Did you have the baby yet? |7| Lets.  Opening Credits _B_ 
 Okay. Wow. |5| So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this?  
 All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas eve and you'd rather be with your familys, but there's *no* call  for writing "Screw you, Mr. Bing!" on the back of my chair!  -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.  |7|  ...AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT!  --- Opening Credits --- _B_ 
 A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid. |4| No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO. 
 David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight! |7| Ok! 
 David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight! |7| Ok! 
  You see what I mean. Opening Credits _B_ |2| I used to have that bumper sticker.  
 Why are you wearing my apron? |2| Hey.

 Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all. |2| It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut " 
 Yeah. |6| Really?! You? 
  Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast! |5| I can't believe this! 
  Hey! _B_ |8| Yeah!  
 Oh, yes, could I have one of those.  |6| Okaaay.  Any of you guys want anything else?

 I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me. |5| Wow that was a big one. 
 Its your parents anniversary and youre going to talk about their dead pet? |6| Its a dead dog. Thats Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school. 
 Alright, lo...look. I don't smoke anymore. But if the restof you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine.  So youall smoke then? That's almost rude, that I'm not. |0| Yes, in Oklahoma it's legal to smoke in offices with fifteenpeople or less.  Would you like one?

 Or what my Father called Thursday night. Opening Credits _B_ |5| All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men. 
 My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me. Opening Credits _B_ |2| Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with. 
 I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair? |5| Now she's passed. _B_ 
 Well, not at first. |5|  Hello, Rachel.

  Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning. |2| Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldnt be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monicas older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down and kick your ass!  What? Im-Im-Im serious!  ComeHey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? Im-Im not kidding here!

 Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it.  But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right? |1|  Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.

 Y'think? |7| You could do that!

 Okay, well Im gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed.  32 Joe. Youre 32!  Front Desk |6| Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until yknow, he screamed out Radisson at the end. 
 Oh hey! |9|  Oh hey you guys! 
 No, were just four people with neck problems. You talk like this.  _B_ The |2|  You think were being obvious? 
  Ken, please! No, I can't, I can't smoke. If I smoke,my wife would kill me. |3| That's not true. If you don't wanna smoke ... 
 Hey. Where've you been? |8| Hey. 
 "Smoke away."  |7| "I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke." 
 You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion. _B_ |7| Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel. 
 Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch? |0| Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily. 
 Look out kids, hes coming!  |8| All right, see you guys.  
 Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper. |2| What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again? 
 You're definitely scaring here. |9| There you go!  
 Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image? |6| Noo!! Its driving me crazy. I mean every other way hes like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything. 
 Wish it!  Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that? |4|  Good luck! 
 Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this |2| Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's?  Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's? 
 What's going on? |2| Damn! 
 I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships. |2| We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret. 
 Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!  |3| I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands... 
 Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps. |6| Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us. 
 Ohh, yeah. |9| It was okay. Shes still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend. 
 You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred |6| No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much! 
 So he has to be a male who has at least $50. |2| Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux. 
 Yeah, Im not sure I can do that. _B_ |3| Well, why dont you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you. 
 So are we friends again? |6| No problem. 
 Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London. |7| Yeah. 
 I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone. |9| "Smoke away."  
 Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom? |2| That's how old you are. 
 We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?  _B_ |3| Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME! 
  I'm leaving you.  _B_ |3|  "...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll"! 
 You can't leave me alone with her. |1| To use the bathroom. 
 Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back. Monica and |6| We make fire. Cook meat. 
 You can't leave me alone with her. |1| To use the bathroom. 
 You got waaaay too much free time. |0| ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. 
 Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship. |4| Agh, it was the graduation from hell. 
 I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep. |0| Hey! 
 Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue... |0| Yeah! 
 Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kids pretzel at them. |5| Oh. 
 Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of. |1| Oh, no thanks. 
 Hey. |8| Hey, Rach! 
 Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, Ill be your boyfriend.  |3|  Thanks! 
 Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.  |3| I dont understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a big, dull dud. 
 Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren. |2| Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that? 
 Oh thats not true! Thats not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it  Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it  Her initials |1| Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, its like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, lets trade! 
 No-no, I dont think you heard me. Are you ready to party?! |6| I dont know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but theres this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch. 
 Well, I have a girlfriend, Im-Im happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy. |2| Yeah! Wait a minute, its been a long time that Ive been single. How come you never offered this before? 
 Oh no-no-no!  |2| Well at least, Im going to mute it. Joey and 
 Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week! _B_ |1| I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here! _B_ 
 No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies. |2| Did I, uh, did I miss something? 
 Okay!  So, what do you girls have planned for tonight? |7|  Okay. 
  Do you know why? |4|  Yeah, they dont like you. 
 Oh, uh, listen, about tonight... |8| Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes. 
 Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up. |7| Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right? Opening Credits _B_ 
 If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do. |2| Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years. 
 So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986? |3| But I-I-I cant stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. Im supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.  What? 
 Die Hard still great! |9| Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady! Opening Credits _B_ 
 Wow thats actually pretty cool. |7| Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, yknow-yknow for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! Its here! Yeah, its right-its right down here! In the biggest library in the university!  
 But we dont know the neighbors. |6| Im gonna hang this basket  on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece. 
 So great things are happening at work and in your personal life! |8| And-and-and not only that, Im gettin a new brain!! 
 I always liked you, Ken.  _B_ |9| I'm sorry, but isn't your wife back in New York? 
  You hear that? You may not be with your familys, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here. |7| I was, uh, checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole ther ham.  
 I didn't know it was a big secret. |2| Wait a minute, who told you?  You are dead meat. 
 Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday. |0|  Hi, Julie. 
 Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago. |3| Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered. 
 That was so lame. |0| Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye. 
 Ok, that's Eric. |5| Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan. 
 Peter Parker. |7| Hardy Boy. 
  Hey. |8| Okay, well maybe not on those levels. 
  Ill go. |6| But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do.  All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, Ill love you like I do in that black thing that you like. 
 No, no, no, you say that proudly. |2| Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the Geller Bowl. 
 Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right. Opening Credits _B_ |6| A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so cliché. Why don't you get a magician?! 
 Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.  _B_ |4|  Would you like to call somebody?  
 Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight? |9| Two. 
 Hey! |8| Hi! 
 Uh Kathy, with K or a C? |5| No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy. 
 I can check that for ya. |7| Shes mad because I know todays her laundry day and that means shes wearing her old lady underpants. 
 We still have porn. |3| Oh no-no-no!  
 Help! |5| We are! Help us! 
 You think? _B_ |7| Need a new table. 
 Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime. Opening Credits _B_ |4| Yeah!! 
  Yeah, all right. |6| Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great! 
 Im gonna grab you some tissue. |8|  I have not been sick in over three years!  
 Oh okay, Ill-Ill try. |7| Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what? 
 Hey! |8|  Hey! 
 Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom. |8| Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy? We call him Hums While He Pees. 
 How long have we been home? |4| No. 
 Okay.  You wont believe what Monicas older brother just said to me! Opening Credits _B_ |5| Yeah. 
 We're notwe're not saying anything. |1| Shut up! 
 You went home with the waitress. |7| This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasnt allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner! 
 If that. _B_ |0| You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me. 
  And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law. |2| That man across the street just kicked that pigeon!  Oh! 
 Relax your hand!  |9| What? 
 When we were? |4| He's... our age. 
 Me too...  |9|  Ooh, I want one... 
 Who? |5| So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric. 
 This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with! |6| What? 
 This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with! |6| What? 
 Had it. |9| Had it. 
 Nope, not this time. |1| B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her. 
 Here goes.  |4| C'mon! C'mon! 
 Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon. |3| Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me. 
 Bye! |7| Okay, bye-bye! 
 Why is that so funny? |3| Yeah right. 
 Oh, come on! Its not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually Im pretty much just in there by myself.  |3| Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now! 
 Do you know which one you're gonna be? |6| You know, the asthma guy was really cute. 
 Kathys with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude! |6| Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town? 
 Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?  |4| Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I dont like guys with boring jobs. 
 Are there no conscious men in the city for you two? |5| I know. _B_ 
 Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party. |7| Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating? 
 Hey! |8|  Hey, you guys! 
 So, what are you gonna do? |5| No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this! 
 It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts. |4| You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies? 
  Well if people dont know they shouldnt just guess! _B_ |4| I dunno, maybe its because youre really sarcastic. Or maybe its cause you uh- 
 Ah, youre still just a little fat girl inside arent you?  |6| Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember! 
  Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.  |7| I know. 
 Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a... |3| No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend. 
 Nah, Monicas watching some cooking show. Come on, I dont want to miss when they were skinny. |2| Lets go watch it at your place. 
 Whoa, she's pretty.  |9| Ugh, how can you even ask that question?! _B_ _B_ 
 It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.  |2| So was it a lot more money? 
 Whatd you rent? |2| Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature? 
 Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.  Female |6|  Oh umm, theres also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that? 
  Okay. _B_ |5| Hi, I'm Ross's little sister. 
 Why not? |4| Why?! 
 You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn? Mr. |6| Wow Bing! Burning the midnight oil. 
  We didnt play it!! Opening Credits _B_ |9| Yeah. Okay.  Whoa!  I almost forgot this was on your 
 Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up!  I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order. |8| My kid's in a play right now. 
 Not so much! |6| Relax your hand!  
 Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you. |7| Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler. 
 There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one? |0| Me too...  
 Okay, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky. |2| All right, bye-bye.  
 Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake. |5| Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? Y'know, like from, like 20? 
 Happy birthday, pal! |9| hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you. 
 Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that. |0| Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady. 
 So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er? _B_ |8| I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him. _B_ 
 Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it? LITTLE |3| _B_ Hey, we were sitting there. 
 Im never gonna find a roommate, ever. |2| Hey. 
 Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings!  Don't cry outloud. |5| She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and,  he's really good looking.  What am I gonna do? 
 Yeah, baby! |8| No its not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven. _B_ 
 Hey, it's me. |9| Hello? 
 Yeah! You wanna come? |7| Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again? 
 Oh, thats-thats okay, no problem.  |1| Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didnt have to walk me all the way back up here. 
 Oh-oh-hey! |9| With a K. 
 It doesn't say that. Does it? |1| Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!" 
 Op, y'know what though, its kindve a girlie briefcase. |8| Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller. 
 Well we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers. |5| I justI cant believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you. 
 Okay. Bye. |5| I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi!  And you, sweetie, Ill see you tonight. 
 It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner. |2| Yeah, you wish! 
 Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?" |2| I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse. 
 Hey. |8| Hey Pheebs, how's it going? 
 Uh, what was that? _B_ |0|  Would you mind doing a picture with us? _B_ 
 Whoa-whoa-whoa! What? |6| Okay, well Ill bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, theyre not actually puppies, theyre Frank and Alices triplets. Okay, see ya!  
 This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for. |8|  Well if people dont know they shouldnt just guess! _B_ 
 Yeah so, Tuesday? |8| All right! Thanks! Youre the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday? 
 Wouldnt it be easier if we just moved? |4| See? This is exactly why Im making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors. 
 Lovely! Opening Credits _B_ |8| About a half an hour. 
 Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannies made some new friends. |6| My God, I cant believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable! 
 Hey.  Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff? |1| Hi. 
 I cant believe you didnt tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty! |8| Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night. 
 Well, Phoebe I thought IdYeah, what the hell.  Opening Credits _B_ |3| OkayOop! Too late! Im leaving! Come on Chandler lets go!  
 No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I dont think they exist. |4| Uh-huh,  and you? 
 Hey Rach! |9| Oh!... Right! 
 I got that! |5| "Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53" 
  Did I go to this school? |2| He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff. 
 It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together. |3| What kind of social situation are you comfortable with? 
 It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together. |3| What kind of social situation are you comfortable with? 
  You bitch. |5| You have a third nipple? 
 You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true. |2| Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut? 
 I'm not yanking you. |1| Come on, quite yankin' me. 
 Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh......hi. |1| ...Yes? 
 Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material? |0| You made a joke right? So I laughed. 
 Okay, I promise, Ill end it. |6| Chandler!!  Promise me, you will end it. 
 Good luck, man. I hope you get it. |9| No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...  
 I know, I can do this.  |7| I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide. 
 I was not flirting. |2| Don't get me started on that.  
 Me?! Why me? |1| I don't know. I'll just handle itI'll ask you to talk to him! 
 Im not your garbage man. Im your mailman. |3| Oh-oh, Pottery Barn!  You can throw the rest away. 
 What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out? |0| Chandler, Chandler, yknow what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.

  Well, Monica and Chandler cant go. Were going to dinner remember?! |8| Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler? 
 What we want honey. |4| Hey, I know what I want! 
  Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again. |4| Die Hard 2. 
 Oooh that may be a New World's record  |8| Done! With time-a to spare. 
 Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing? |3| Lovely! Opening Credits _B_ 
  Smooth. |9| Yknow actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system.  Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!  
 All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me? |2| Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more." _B_ 
 Whats funny about that? |3| Youre a joker Bing.  
 I didnt know you read tea leaves. |7| Okay, so when youre done with your tea Ill look at your leaves and tell you your fortune. 
 Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks! |0|  "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet". 
 Hey! |8| Whoah! 
 How about Joey... Pepponi? |2| This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother. _B_ 
 Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are? |7| College? 
 Wow! |8| ooh... 
 I was kidding. |2| ...and head to Canada! 
 YOU NEVER DID IT! |9| Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau... 
 We're taking a break! |0| Try it, I can't feel a thing!  Monica  Are, are you kidding? This is packing? 
 Look guys, I know it's a little steep. |8| Do we need a cake? 
 What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia. |1| That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who? 
 No actually, I was just going for colorful. BIG |6| Is that supposed to be funny? 
  What a geek! |9| Well I-I-I, that kind of thing requires some serious thought. First, Ill divide my perspective canidates into catergories.... 
 Well lets see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thats plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing! |8| Why, nobody good? 
 Oh, y'know what, Im gonna be okay, you dont have to throw a party for me. |4| Hey Chandler, theres a party tomorrow, youll feel better then. 
 I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer. |3|  Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical? 
 Making chocolate milk. Do you want some? |5| What are you doing? 
 Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr. |7|  It's Chandler!  Are you OK?

 Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here. |4| Wow! You are really good at this. 
 Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great. |1| How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange? 
 Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start! |5| Who cares? He works in a museum! 
  And you Ross, I believe, if you check Rachels bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there. |8| Yeah, whats that about? 
 Bye. |7| Bye. 
 Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. |1| Yeah, okay. Alright. 
  Happy New Year! |9|  3! 2! 1! HAPPY NEW YEAR!!  
 Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment. |5| Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin up, eh? 
 Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh? _B_ |7| Hi. She said yes.

 Okay.  |5| Okay. 
 You didnt bring me here to do that, did you? _B_ |4| Sorry! 
 Your sister Ursula. |8| Okay, look, this could be a really long game. 
 Eh, somebodys in a good mood! |7|  Gooood morning!! 
  Sorry!  _B_ |4|  Uh, hello dad! Monica and I just saw the house in the paper!  Yes were surprised!  Who did you leave a message with? 
 Yeah but you dont needWhat is this? |2| Why not? Its built into the price of the room. 
  We were playing poker, alright... |4| Thank you. 
 Toootal chick-flick. |8| Suck-fest.

 Okay.  |5| You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes. 
 What's in the bag? |3| Hey. 
 Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet. MR |2| That's him. 
 I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old _B_ -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings. |6| C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh. 
 Why her mom? |3| Well, how bout just her mom? 
 Yeah, I know. She makes me happy. |7| This is Janice. 
 Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.  |4| Yes, you said that. 
 Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, its the only chance to see New York. _B_ |9| Really?  
 Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred. |5| 98 hot saves, highest in the force. 
 Okay, so weve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we werent friends, say its a blind date. I show up at your door, and Im like  Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey. |7| Well, no. Youre Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!  
 Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land. |5|  Hey, heres a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi? 
 I hope you know what Im giving up for ya, because shes not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean. |4| Thank you. 
 Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but Ive missed the last 1200 times. |2|  My God! Is this a gym card? 
 Im gonna call and get off work tomorrow! |2| Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world. 
 Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding. |5| Pregnant?! _B_ 
 Hi, Pheebs! |9| Hey, Phoebe! 
 I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be. |3| Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a man! 
 Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies. |1| Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change. 
 Yeah, Im gonna pass. Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies. |2| Dont worry about it Phoebe, well absolutely do it. 
 Joey, why is your cable out? |4| No, thats VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . Its like a lotta noise to me. I dont know 
 Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.  |8| You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm? 
 Why not? |4| No. 
 Hey thats okay. So, where do you want to go? |3|  Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long. 
 Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt,  and I think my testacles may be in here too. |8| Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon? 
 Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops? |7| Son of a bitch!  Opening Credits _B_ 
 I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your familys tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to. |2| *Now* it feels like Christmas. 
 Alright, now try taking a puff.  |3| Hey! 
 Joey... Switzerland?  |3| No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral. 
 Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death .|4| my first period. 
 Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me. |6| I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing. 
 Well, it makes me feel sad, but... |0| You okay with this?

 Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.  |3| Its Joeys birthday.

 Bye. |7| Bye.

 Oh, uh, I... don't... care.  Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess. |0|  How do I look? 
  Isnt she cute?  No! |8| Im the student. 
 I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there. |0| So what're you going to do? 
 I just get mad when Rachel doesnt remember where were going. |8| Whats the big deal? 
 Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh... |5|  Oh, really. 
 I used to undress my cousin Glenn.  _B_ |3| Yknow, she tried to undress me too. 
 As in Barbara Streisands husband James Brolin? |2| Okay, okay. Its James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby. 
 Score! Where are the disposable cameras? |3| Thread! 
  Hey, what was that all about? |4| Bye.  
 What? |4| Well last night, I met Monicas. 
 Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me. |0| Alright, now try taking a puff.  
 No, not yet. |3| Hey, are Ross and Rachel back? 
 Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day. |0| Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so... ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel. 
 You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her. |9| Dude. You're married to my sister. 
 Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty." |7| So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? 
 Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh? |7| Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute. 
 Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim  museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words. |5| So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that . 
  I'm not breaking up with her!  _B_ |3| Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking. 
 You're right, I know. |4|  Fire safety is not a joke, son. 
 You dont think Ive tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria. |4| So why dont you quit? 
 Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey.  |9| Hey! 
 This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore! Chandler and |8| Im gonna call after you! 
 Yes, but in Rosss case, they both know in two weeks thats it.  |7| Hey thats what all my relationships are like. 
 Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax. |5|  Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound' the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.  
 Uh, hey! |6| Hi! 
 Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme? |3| Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine. 
 I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh,  this is Monica.  This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica. |9| Hey Bing!   Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you? 
 I was not and oh God, shh! |0| Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl! 
  Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.  Opening Credits _B_ |5| That is so sweet!  
 Okaaay,  rock, hard place, me. |7| Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice. 
 Hey! |8|  Saved your ass. Opening Credits _B_ 
 Hey. _B_ |8| _B_. _B_ Janine _B_ Hey.

 If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money? |0| I uh, oh! Because, uh, I havent really paid the bill 
 You just thought of that in there? |8|  Hey Mon? Im gonna check my messages. 
 Oh, ok. |5| It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.  
 They have that on the napkins at the club. |4| Hey, divorced men are not bad men! 
 What are you crazy? That's a baby! |5| Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field. 
 Ross! Its got your wavy black lines! |4| Oh great!  
 And then he did. |8| Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.' 
 The Hard Rock Café? |4| Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go. 
 Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla. _B_ Ms. |2| See this is what I was afraid of, I didn’t think I should be here either but somebody  said he’d be over it by now. 
 Haha, no thanks! |9| You can come to my house! 
 Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin? |7| Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.  Which I'm not. 
 I see. |7| Talking to Ross. 
 Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts? |1| I don't know. Maybe church-camp? 
 Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts? |1| I don't know. Maybe church-camp? 
 Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it. |7|  Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes. 
 Ok, this could be tough. |3| How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car? 
 What just happened? LITTLE |1| Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee. _B_ 
 Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, its supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh. _B_ Mr. |0| Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.  
  Put Joey on the phone. |8| I have no idea what you just said. 
 No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called wait until the last moment before I burst and die.  |4|  Someone in there? 
 Yeah, and I dont have any cologne. |4| Joey, what are you doing?! Its never gonna happen, shes seeing somebody. 
 B-bye! |6| Bye. 
 Yknow when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine? |3| In case youre wondering, and I know you are. Their names are all back to normal. Just in a slightly smaller font than usual to allow Courteney Cox Arquette to fit on one line and not be smaller than the rest of their names. Now, on with the show } _B_ 
 Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure wed do nothing. |0| Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night? 
 ...And what did you bring? |6| Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice. 
 Oh my God, introduce us! |5| Oh my God, Rachel!  
 Dying people say the craziest things. |6| You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family? 
 Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years. |2| Rifts. Yeah, I know. 
 Hey! |8|  Oh, hey, you guys! 
  There are seven?!  Thats one? |8| Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones.  You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven! 
 Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thats because I didnt send him an invitation. |1| Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad. 
 The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them? |1| What disposable cameras? 
  What?! I didnt even know thatWhy didnt you tell me?!  Why am I talking like this?! |0| Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby. 
 Come on, dont be crazy.  You dont think theres someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya?  |1| Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half. 
 Thats great. |9| Oh cool! 
 It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.  |5| No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette. 
 Those are all really old! |6|  Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "Liar, Liar" or "Betrayal", or... "An Affair To Remember". 
 Are you asking permission to break the pact? |2| Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out? 
 No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.  |0| You got it! . All right, she's right, we gotta get serious.  Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him! 
 Crazy bitch. |5| Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me. 
 I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing. |8| Yeah, you're right. 
 Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves. _B_ _B_ |7| Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner? 
  It means we're holding hands. |5| What does she mean by HH? 
 And was the curse lifted? |7| Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, nobody won that game,  and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and....  threw it in the lake. 
 Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high? |7| No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called wait until the last moment before I burst and die.  
  Okay, that hurt us. |2| Chloe, switch with me, theres some guys here that got a crush on you. 
 No. |4|  Is he here? 
  Stunning entertainment center. Fine,  fine Italian craftsmanship.  |9| Yeah. 
 Oh Maria. You cant say no to her, shes like this lycra spandex covered gym treat. |9| Who is Maria? 
 Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth. |2| Hey, I see you guys already met, huh? 
 Or a job where you dont have to carry a table. |5| Ohh, Im getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Yknow, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table.  
 Ho! Ho! Ho! |4|  Hello! 
 We're flipping Monica's mattress. |6| What's going on? 
 Dude! That's my girlfriend! |8| They're gonna do it together. 
 Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that? |9| You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops. 
 Whoa ho. |6| No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot. 
 Know what I mean? |3|  Yknow what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes!  Youre not getting dressed.  
 I am only one man!  Okay Ross, time is up! |7| All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food! 
 Ross, a sports car? Wouldnt it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there? |2| How hot do I look in this, huh?! 
 Again?! |2| Yeah! 
 Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areasand offices with fewer than fifteen people. |4| 'kay, see you there. Happy humping!  Hey...hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god,don't people know, you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces? 
 Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker. |9| That was a nice pep-talk. 
 Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete. |4| It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.  
 Well, it does not ring a bell with me... |3| Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar. 
 There's a hair in my coffee.  |4| God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives. 
 Hey! |8|  Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free. _B_ 
 Oh, those places! There's always so many people, they're being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"! |0| Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building... 
 Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.  |6| What? 
 Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.  |6| What? 
 Hello. |9| Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves. _B_ _B_ 
 Ooh, you almost had it. _B_ |7| _B_ Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar. 
 That, that is funny. Can I have it back? LITTLE |5| I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat.

 Thanks, its ah, Gaelic, for Thy turkeys done. So ah, Im gonna go, nice, nice meeting you. |9| Bing! Thats a great name. 
 Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.  Opening Credits _B_ |8| The green bottle next to the shaving cream. 
 Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag. |3| Five. 
 Bye.   I cant stand the woman!  |5| Bye-bye. 
 Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.  |0| Whose little ball of paper is this?! 
 Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No? |2| C'mon, she's your mom! 
 I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool. |5| Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow. 
 No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict. |6| Of course! Joey wouldnt let you have one? 
 Oh, whats the matter? |3| Hey! 
 You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets! |6| I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed! 
 Janice?  |9| She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice. 
 Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant. |1| Hi!  Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so.... 
 Yeah, I just got uh, got plans. |4| Dude, you didnt say Die Hard. Is everything okay? 
 Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad. |8| Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father. 
 Oh, yknow-yknow what, I was looking at it upside down. |3| Its kind of an important one! 
 I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not that close. I havent seen him in years. |0| Chandler! Hes your father; he should be at the wedding. 
 Yknow I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal. |2| How about just the bridemaids? 
 Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said |5| No you didnt. 
  What?!  I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets. |9| I didnt think you could keep it a secret. 
 Youll be perfect for this! Thats already your name! |7| Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day Ill  Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night Ill be  Joey Trrrribbiani! 
 Walter . _B_ |9| Boston is down, Atlanta is down, Houston is down, I could go on and on but instead of boring you I’ll go straight to my forty two point plan.  
 Can you hear that? |5| There you go. _B_ 
 How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall! |3| I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey? 
 Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's |6| Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK? 
 Mrs Hannigan? |5| All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan. 
  What the hell is this? |0| You guys hear a ringing? 
 One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this. _B_ |2| Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.  
 One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this. _B_ |2| Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.  
 Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship. |8| It's gonna be a problem, isn't it? 
 You know, I think I might just.  |3| Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight.   Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you? 
 Excuse me? |1| Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan. 
 I'm afraid I might just be. |6| Are you the cutest? 
 Hi. |8| Chandler. 
 Umm, hows it going with you guys? |4| I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo... 
 See, thats why I could never be an actor. Because I cant say gig. |2| Yay!! 
  Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, Im-Im talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name. |2| Someone was in the lady's room, I couldnt wait. I left the lid up for ya though.  
 Well ah, ........y'know. |6| Hi guys. I havent seen you since this morning. 
 No! |2| You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand? 
 Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts. |3|  People are trying to sleep in here! 
 Yes, every single one of them. |9| And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays. 
 Your pants! |7| Excuse me. 
 Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?  |6| Well 
 Huh. |5| Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance. 
 What, what are you laughing at? |8| We are there!  
  All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place? |2| I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book . 
 Theres gonna be a wedding. Youre gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress. |4| Yeah, but I dont think we have time. 
 Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean yknow you cant date him right? |2| Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker. 
 Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself. |6| No, just give me another minute. 
 They're still just friends, right? |4| Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are. 
 Hes not snoozing, hes teaching a class. |4| Well, well Ross didnt care enough to be here, so I think hes out. You snooze you lose. 
 No! I just happened t'do a lot trivias about smoking indifferent states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are calledLeyhallalookoos. |0| You smoked! 
 Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional... _B_ _B_ |9| So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing? 
 Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke.  Oh.. my.. God.  _B_ |2| Y'miss it? 
 Might wanna try Joseph.  |0|  Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good. 
 Awesome, the name really stands out. |9| Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room! 
 You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them. |9| Hey! 
 Joey was in a porno movie. |1| Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin. 
 Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone? |6| What's wrong with the twentieth? 
 No? BIG |9| No. 
  She said yes!! She said yes!!  Awful play, man. Whoah.  Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way.  Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.  |6|  Saw your head. Saw your head. 
 Is anybody else scared? |7|  'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.' 
 The abridgment. |0| The what? 
 Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind. _B_ |4|  Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Chandler, listen.  
  Oh, Ill go out and get you some. |6|  Shoot! Were out of soda. 
 You want it? Phoebe and |2| Why? I love that thing. 
  Hi! |9| Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People.  Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you?  This chick sounds good.  Smelly cat, smelly-- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey. _B_ 
 All right! Bring it on, you |5| Okay, guys. 
 Yeah, its like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it! |0| Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin guy. 
 Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personalityWell, theyre all back! Yknow? And shes picked up like nine new ones! |5| What?! I thought you were crazy about her! 
 Maybe thats because soy-burgers suck! |1|  Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, yknow? And I got nauseous. 
 Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.' |5| Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool! 
 No, sir. |0| Say uh, Bing, did you hear about the new law firm we got working for us? 
 Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter. _B_ |7| What's with him? 
 Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like? |8| You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way? 
 No, no, I keep trying, yknow? I can get out, "Joey, I have too " but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, " go to the bathroom." He may think Im sick. |2| Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youre moving out? 
 Yeah? |7| Well, you know that psychic I see? 
  And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open. _B_ |7| So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine. 
  Hey, it's Janice. _B_ |6| Oh.... my.... God. 
 Well, you couldnt get them anyway. Ian doesnt play anymore and Derrick  And Derrick is a name I shouldnt know. |3| A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding. 
 Our kids are gonna be fat arent they. |6| Okay. Im gonna be the mom that makes the worlds best chocolate chip cookies. 
 No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch. |2| Well, John McClane had plans! 
 Well he doesnt have to know! Its not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas. |5| Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?! 
 So you dont have the cameras?! |5| Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?"  Yeah, then you did that. 
 Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.  |7| What secrets? 
 There just don't happen to be any women in our games. |3| Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it? 
 You like the Purple Rain display!  Hey Bob. |8| Im telling you, I like the food! 
 See that'll stop when you pick up the phone. |4|  Yeah? 
 Anything? |3| I'm on it! 
 Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes? |8| How is that gonna happen? 
 Well, I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window. |1| What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we? 
 Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her. |0| You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy. 
 Ginger. Im talking to Ginger, so.... |8| Ginger. 
 Yes, yes, its just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross. |9| You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me.  Okay, I said that out loud right? 
 Oh no, youll have to come. _B_ Mr. |4| So youre strong enough to face her on your own? 
 Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. |3| Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. 
 Aww, man!  |0| Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too? 
 Do you want us to leave the room, or? |4| Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy. 
 Uhhuh, how did you know that? |4| I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty. 
 Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window. |6|  Hey, it's Janice. _B_ 
  Paid your phone bill? |0| Sure. 
 Oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business. |4| C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big! 
 Well, you could also give back the money you owe me. |6| Hey, yknow what? Ill come too. Im making money now; its about time I give something back. 
 Okay, but if you can't no dinner! |2| This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner. 
 Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again? |9| Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news. 
 Well, only if you order stuff. |3| Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive? 
 Hey Rach!  _B_ |9| Are you okay? _B_ _B_ _B_ 
 Happy Valentines! |8| Thanks so much, Pheebs!  We are going to have so much fun, yes we are!  Oh! Not that kind of fun. _B_ 
 Ha! |7| No, no, no wait! Dont tell me. Let me guess.  Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel and, Im sorry Phoebe didnt mention you.  Chandler, Im kidding all ready youre my favorite! 
 I havent seen this dress. |0| Well then somebodys snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here.  
 Sure. |6|  Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second? 
 Yes! |8| Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?  
 Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it? |2|  Chandler, you stink of cigarettes. 
 Dont you think its better for him to think that youre cheating on me than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? _B_ I heard it! |3| Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you are not in Tulsa. 
 Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof. _B_ |8| Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that! 
 You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.  |5| Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets. 
 Hey you guys. |9| Central Perk. Rachel, Joey and Emma are there.] 
 You're gonna be great. |7| Uh, we're gonna be great. 
 Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union! |8| Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"! 
 No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding. |1| Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us? 
 Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us? |7|  Hey guys. 
 I didn't know Monica had these! |5| Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out. 
 If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.  |8| Huuh. 
 _B_ Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon. |0| Never mind, it's open. 
 No, I'm alright, thanks. |6| Do you want a refill? 
 Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad! |3|  'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?'  I need a pen.  
 Nope! Because Im not your boyfriend.  Hey Pheebs, how did it go? |7| Really?! 
 Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane? |4| Oh no. 
 Jeez, at 230 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote. |0| Hi. 
  Oh my God! Play!  |1| Here we go.  Yknow, Ive-Ive never played my stuff for anyone before, so its important that-that you understand its about communicating very private emotions.  Yknow, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. Thats what Im 
 Well maybe you should put some ice on it. |7| Oh, yknow what, I cant, it really kills. 
 Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, whos boss. |2| I would love too, but I cant! I mean I just cant, you know that Im not good at confrontation. 
 Im totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then theyre gonna go to their cast parties and hes gonna try to undermine me. Y'know itll be like, "So wheres your boyfriend, whats-his-name, Chester?" And shell go, "No-no-no, its Chandler." And hell go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!" |1| Thats a good idea for a business! 
 Dont worry about it. Im taking care of it tonight.  |5| So what are you doing bringing her here?! Theres people here! 
  That guy's going home with a note! |8| Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear! 
 You can say that because she's not your mom. |6| C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast. 
 Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence |9| Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing. 
 Weirder than watching his two moms make out?  |5| Yeah. 
 Oh, so thats this is gonna work now? Youre just gonna order me around all the time? |2| Yknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but I We just have to get it over with! Yknow, the next time we see them were just gonna tell them. Okay? Thats it. 
 What?! |3| Well, she told me that Im gonna die this week, so Im kinda bummed about that. 
 Hey! |8| Hey! Ross and 
  Im not worried, Im uh, Im fascinated. Yknow its like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.  |3|  Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it! 
 Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place? |0|  Hey Mon, do you have another pillow?  Yknow, something a little snugglyer? 
 Hey! Hows the boat?! |4|  Ahoy! 
  Monica! |8|  Oh no! No! No!  _B_ 
  Monica |0| Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica 
 Trust me, you dont want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress. |3| Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles. 
 So? What? What? Theyre gone! Monicas gonna freak! |0| No. Sorry man. 
 You already know. Opening Credits _B_ |5|  Youll tell me later? 
 A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe! |8| Of course, of course. 
 What does yours say Pheebs? |8| Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab. 
 I can save you time ladies, I'm right here. |6| Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet. 
 Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did. |7| I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys! 
  C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy,  Huh? Huh? Huh? |2| The hell with hockey, let's all do that! 
 So you really Okay about all this? |3| Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity. 
 Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do? |4| Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesnt really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think its gonna make a difference _B_ 
 But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom wont let me cross the street. _B_ |4| All right, were gonna play. 
 Nope, nope, Id just ah, Id rather talk to you.  Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.  |2| Dont you have to use the bathroom? 
 Youre gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station? |4| Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? Im gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give. 
 Hey! Do we have a baby name yet? |8| Hey! 
 Santa pants.  Santa Clauss pants. |7| What? 
 It's exactly like it sounds. Thanksgiving 1992 _B_ |7| Hey, it's not like it sounds. 
 You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?! |4|  Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what.  I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!! 
 Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months! |1| No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down. 
 What are you smiling about? What is so funny? |8| Come on!  
 OH MY GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didnt tell her we were getting married, did you? |1| So, whos the lucky guy? _B_ 
 Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym. |6| Oh, Pheebs, Im sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class. 
 Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him. |4| Yeah, why not? 
 You mean the spitter? |5| What about the second minister we met with? I kinda liked him. 
 Yeah, he thinks thats my name. |3| Did that guy just call you Toby? 
 Honey, you remember my boss Doug right? |9| Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette! 
  Candy and Cookie. Candy and Cookie? Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!!   Man on |5|  Okay! Ill be right out. Im slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty. 
 Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time. |3| Awesome! 
 That was you?! I thought it was Jack! |4| Dude I just did something terrible. 
 I have my reasons. |4| Why? 
 Pheebs? |9| Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound ...and the breasts of a great goddess. 
 Alright. Ive got a plan. Ill go down the fire escape |8| I dont want him to think that I'm having an affair. 
 I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops. |2|  Mr. Bing's office.  No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now. 
 Hey! |8| Hey guys! 
 Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves! |3| Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard! 
 The one time they're not home. |2| Let's get out of here. _B_ 
 _B_ I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's. |4| OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. _B_ Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now. 
 Hey, kids. |6| Based on this play? ...Based on this play! _B_ 
 Hey! |8|  Hey! 
 I found a dried up seashores. |8| Well, umm, my Moms friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.  
 All right look, Im changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer. |4| Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks! 
 Oh my God! That's why I got up too! |4| I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch. 
 Really, bitchin! |5|  Boy, that was-that was, umm terrific. 
 All right, look, look, what am I gonna do? |1|  That-that is a good trick. 
  Well, I dont have to break up with her this time. Were not involved! Im going to do a pre-emptive strike! Im going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!  |2| You are not. You have never been able to break up with her. 
 That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths. |4| Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet. 
 What? |4| What was that? 
 All right. |5| Pretty much. 
 I didn't nail the boxes to the floor. |3|  Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor! 
 Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat. |4| Yeah, I know!  So, what do you think? 
 I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon? |1| Shes sleeping. 
 Dont do it. |9| Wouldnt you love to do it just once?!  
  Yeah? |7| " when I look back over our time together " 
 Great. |9| Well, Im sure theyre still somewhere here in the hotel. Ill-Ill help you look for them. 
 I can't believe we are even having this discussion. |2| 'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there. _B_ 
 Nice work my friend. |8| Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line,  you know that's bad for the paper tray. 
 Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...? |4| Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic! 
 Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...? |4| Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic! 
 You do realise that's your brother? |4| Bedsprings, unmistakable! 
 Emma, how old are you? How old are you today?  |9| What? 
 Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part. |3| Oh! Any word on casting yet? 
 Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city. |9| All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house. 
 Ok, Phoebe. |5| Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building.  Go into the light, Mr. Heckles! 
  I have no idea. |2| What are you doing? 
 Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat? BIG |3| Because it's a special hat. _B_ See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler... 
 Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never. |6| Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope thats cool. 
 Yeah, hes really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine. |4| Hm-mm. 
 Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid. |3| Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book  and found nothing! I want a name thats really like, yknow strong and confident, yknow? Like-like Exxon. 
  Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! |0| That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. 
 Who was it? |4| Hey!  Dude, some guy just called for you. 
 Thats weird. I dont think my boss likes me either. |1| But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesnt see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesnt like me very much. 
 I dont think so. |8| Did she just ask me out on a date? 
 You made pottery? |3| Hey! I made that for her! 
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right.  Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!! _B_ |0|  Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous. 
  Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon! |5| Oh yknow whats sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that. 
 So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do? |1| Oh that is quite all right maam.  
 Did she freak out? |2| Well, she saw the ring. 
 No reason, except she told me. |1| Why do you think she's having so much fun living with Joey? 
 Easy for you to say; youll be wearing a veil. |8| Come on! It wasnt that bad! 
 Oh its been going on way to long now. Yknow, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didnt say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now its five years later, the donuts gone and Im still Toby. |5| Well, why dont you correct him? 
 I love you, St. Valentine.  |7| Yeah, just relax. 
 Bamboozled? |6|  All right! Lets play Bamboozled! 
 What?! Why does she think that? |0| No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me! 
  Okay, something to cover the smell ... Ovencleaner!  Unscented! |2|  I'm gonna go.  
 Hear me out, woman! Ill go down the fire escape, then Ill wait for a while. Then, when I come back up the stairs, itll just be like I got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in here and see that there is no guy in here. |5| Yes. Because all good plans start with Ill just go down the fire escape  
 What? That's terrible! |0| We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica. 
 What? |4| Will he know what this is in reference to?  And he has your number?  All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye. 
 Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow. |6| I want a baby. 
 You know, our band is playing on Friday. |7| Hey, Missy... 
 I'm so sorry... |0| Honey. 
 We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright. |7| Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't. 
 You understood that? |7| Consider it done. 
 That's how radio stars escape stalkers. |6| OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met. 
 Chandler. _B_ |8| I'm Gail. 
 How do you not fall down more? |3| Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men. 
 All right, rock on.  _B_ |8| Great. Ill ah, see ya then. 
 What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I cant have children!! |1| Hey-hey, check out the hat!  
  Nooo. |3| What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant. 
 Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've... |1| You're kidding! Oh, I love him. 
 Hes really picky about his patients. |8| No, my eye doctor is Richard! I cant go to him when I dont have a boyfriend! 
 I thought it was $98.50. |0| Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go. 
  Stop that now!  |6| Well be starting with apples. 
 Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"  |3|  Can you hear anything? 
 Oh, that was my work laugh. |8| That noise you just made? 
 Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up. |4| I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool? 
 Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you. _B_ |8| Oh, So you can move them! 
 Can you see my nipples through this shirt? |4| OK.  Oh Monica! Guess what! _B_ 
 Oh, so youre already doing your part for the kids. |6| Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth. 
 Sure, you guys dont have this problem, youre made of wood.  Hey! |3| If you wouldve let me finish, it goes on to say that hes probably not gay. _B_ 
 Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding? |4| Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up! 
 Dude that is so sad. |0| Maybe I should open a divorced mens club. 
 Sorry, I just cant sleep. Ooh!  Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover Im like  |5| Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is whats going to happen to you if you wake me up. 
 I have no idea. |2| Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me.   So hows the game? 
 I didnt know you and Carol were getting divorced, Im sorry. |1| Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M. 
 I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already? |0| I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief. 
 Woah, woah, thats not pretty! Man on |7| I love you, St. Valentine.  
 You really want to take me? |2|  Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-PhoebeBurrrrr!  
  What?  May I? |5| If you want to check your email, just ask!  
  What?  May I? |5| If you want to check your email, just ask!  
 That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al. |3| Not until you said it. Somebody switch!  Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with. 
 Thank you so much for agreeing to see us. |8|  Hi... 
 Hi! |9|  I got them! _B_ 
 Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame. |7| This is my father, this is a picture of my dad. 
 No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page. _B_ |3| You got a problem with that? 
 Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went. |5|  No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line. 
 Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think youre chances are pretty good.  All right.  _B_ |7| Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sisters beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, shes a porn star.  
 Yes! |8|  Stop that now!  
 Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! |0| What? 
 Yeah, I know that means buddy! |4| And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas!  And you know what that means buddy! 
 Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer! |0|  You didnt cry when Bambis mother died? 
 Oh, tell her good luck with that. |0| Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow. 
 Right. |6| Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people. 
 No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now. |0| Really? So she said, she didnt wanna live with me anymore? 
 You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest? |2| All right, what about the third guy? 
 No! That would be so awkward! LookBesides, we work in different departments. Hes on the sixth floor yknow? So he calls me Toby once in a while. Whats the big deal? It could be worse, its not like hes calling me Muriel.  |0| Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him! 
 Who cares? Its a stupid game. |1| Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game! 
 Again, what?! |3| Because it kinda looked like I did. 
 No thanks, I'm good. |9|  Welcome home. I've missed you. join mein the bedroom? 
 Just gonna wait for a little while. |9| Arent you afraid that Joeys going to figure all this out? _B_ I heard it! _B_ 
 Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible. |0| No-no, we do it every year! 
 Ah! |7| Ross says hi. 
 Ok, ok, here we go. |4| Oh my God, the adoption lady is early! 
 Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.  |3| Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee. 
 What do you think Pheebs? |8| But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look? 
 Is he the one with the beautiful wife? _B_ |7| Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue. 
 You got it.  |9| Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? 
 What? _B_ Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap. |1| I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you. 
 This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir? _B_ MRS. |7| I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it? 
 All right.  "My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married! |7| Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?' 
  Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by,  Bye-bye. |9| Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think youre chances are pretty good.  All right.  _B_ 
 Y'know, I wouldve bet good money that hed be the first one of us to get married. |6| Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck.  Im gonna, Im gonna get my ah, my fiancée man! 
  Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's? |0|  Well?! 
 I cant believe you dont know what I do for a living! |5| Oh. What do you do? 
 So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class. |7| Oh please! 
  Yes. _B_ |6| Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials? 
 I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!"  And it starts right now! |3| In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week. 
 Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too. |2| Really? Your work laugh? 
 Sure! |8| Okay listen, yknow when you move in Rachels room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it? 
 Just out of curiosity did she tell you how youre gonna go? |3| I dontshe said yknow that Id have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black. 
 Hey-hey, is Monica here? |9| Yknow what  
 You look great! |9| Hey! 
 Okay. |5| Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too! 
 Well, its good that you finally have a place to do that. |3| Oh, its great! Its a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.  
 Could I play? _B_ |8| I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back. 
 What?!  Ow!  _B_ |0| It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin. 
 There it is! So what're you gonna do? |4| You take your time.  
 This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins. |0|  Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours. 
 You'll get one. |7| No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two? 
 Yeah! Im just pretending to watch the game so I dont have to help out with stuff. |6| What? 
  No! |2|  Yeah! 
 So youre never actually going to pay me back? |1| Yeah! Yeah! I mean Im sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but yknow Chandler always supported my career. Hes paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back. 
 I'll tell you what. For the rest of our lives, I'll be careful, until told otherwise. _B_ |5| Careful. Careful.. CAREFUL! 
 Okay Buckwheat! |5| Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon. 
 If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!  |5| We are not friends with Phoebe anymore. 
 Joe... |7| Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor!  Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! . Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in. 
 I was in the car with Nancy all day. |5| Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes. 
 Damn it. |7| You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN! 
 Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.  |4| Yeah, it's really 600 tomorrow night our time. 
 Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor. |7| Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point. _B_ 
 It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...  |6| Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'? 
 And then Tineals. |9| All right, we have to pick captains. 
 I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now?  Og-ee-op, Im not asking for me, Im I mean No, Im-Im not gay, Im not asking you out. Im not-Im not-Im not gay! |1|  Yes. _B_ 
 Diet soda. |6| Okay. Uhh, tortilla chips, yogurt. 
 Hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youre gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.  Oh, come on! Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get to know him. |9| Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joeys your pal. Joeys your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, theyre hanging out with Joey." 
 Well, what did the police say? |3| Someone at work ate my sandwich! 
 It is starting to get dark out there. |6|  That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy. 
 Yeah lets head off to work. |4| Or maybe, its because youre hanging around here at 1130 on a Wednesday.  
 Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore _B_ |8| Okay fine! Ill-Ill just tell her its an antique apothecary table, she doesnt have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs. 
 Im not macho. |2| Chandler theres nothing wrong with crying! I mean you dont have to be so macho all the time. 
 Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo." |4| Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man? 
 Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didnt agree to that! |4| Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going? 
  You said no, right? |7| Well, she actually has a boyfriend yknow herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too. 
 Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment. |6| Chandler? Can you give me a hand?  
 Sorry, I just dont like the idea of when I say "I do," hes thinking, "Yeah, Id do her too!" |0| Can you blame him? 
 Shh! It is a family name! |7|  Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel?  Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? Its not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!! 
 I dont suck. Its sucks. You suck. |0| You only think its stupid because you suck at it. 
 Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever!  Woman on |0| Ow! Ow! Ooh! That hurts! 
 Luckily, the guy she settled for cant hear what youre talking about. |3| Oh, its so sad they never had a chance to meet. 
 Well, Im sure you get another one at Ann Taylors. |5| Great! Great. Then I mustve left it at Monas. I knew it! 
 As we all are at some point during the day. |7| Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand… 
  Right. You know what? Actually I just getoff the plane, so I'm feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take ashower. |2|  O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you? 
 Wait a minute. This isn't the china we picked out... |1| I'll tell you what. For the rest of our lives, I'll be careful, until told otherwise. _B_ 
 Its huge! _B_ _B_ |7| Scary pigeons back? 
 Well, now, I actually have to get to work. |2| This is so fun. All right, what do we do now? 
 Here we go. Stand up straight.  Big smile.  |8| Ok. 
 Ok. |5| I'll let you get acquainted. 
 Yeah. |6| Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard? 
 Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia. |7| So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special? 
 Wait, wait, wait. _B_ _B_ |3| Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready? 
 Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. _B_ |5| It's not that bad. 
 I can't believe she's married. |2| Well at least we know she's a woman. 
 Sure. Ummm. Whats up? |4| Dont you ah, dont you wanna ask me any questions? 
 That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him. |2| Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out. 
 Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I dont belong here." |4| Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game? 
 Okay.  |5| All right, check me out. 
 Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs. |8| Oh wait, my grandmother's dead. 
 No-o-o!  No?  No-o-o! Look Joey, heres the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, Im gonna be moving out man. |3| Oh my God! Youre pregnant! 
 Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones! |5| Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much. 
 so then the farmer says, "Thats not a cow and youre not milking it."  |2| Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore _B_ 
 Oh, are we playing this?! |6| Its your turn. 
 You okay over there? |7|  Oh, thanks. 
 Centerpieces! |9| Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces? 
 And your friend Phoebe? |9| What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula. 
 All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one? |0| Oh yeah? When? 
  OK, so now we draw cards. |6| No. _B_ 
 Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.  |3| I dont believe you! That is brilliant! And Monica has no idea? 
 And a bagel with only |5| Uh, double latte, extra foam. 
 No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents! |4| Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK? 
  Oh, no, no, no dear God, no! |0| It's not the time Charlie. 
  Oh, no, no, no dear God, no! |0| It's not the time Charlie. 
 Fine! |8| Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses! 
 Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that! |4| Nancy doesn’t smoke! 
 Fresh! |9| Right. I'll be there.  
 So, basically just a Chinese guy. |1| Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus. 
 It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor. |4| But don't you need experience for a job like that? 
 Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it. |7| ...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories. 
 We dont, really. |4| Hey, how do you guys get anything done? 
 Buy it for ya, or win it for ya? |7| Ohh, thank you. 
 See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up. |7| I didnt think you were gay. I do now. 
 Orange juice. |7| Yes. Yes. Yes.  
 Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, hell be there. And hell bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youre really hot. |2| Oh well, hey, Joeys loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, hell be there. 
 Condoms? |6| Ooh, Madlibs, mine!  
 Ross, it's just a sandwich! |2| My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it! 
 So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud! |6| This is so cool! 
 Oh hi! |9|  Hey everyone! 
 No, I guess I just never really cried. Yknow? Im not a crying kind of guy. |2| Yeah youre right. I dont know what I was thinking. 
 Okay, look I need your help, I dont know what to get her for Valentines Day. |5| No. 
 Hey, you guys all know what you want to do. |6| Career counselor? 
 You said no, right?! |3| Huh? 
 Yeah! |8| Well then we still have a problem. 
 I am trying! _B_ |3| Ohhh! Make it stop! 
 You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him? |4| Oh, Im so sorry. Um, and maybe Im wrong! I butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more. 
 I always knew you were gonna make it. Im so proud of you. |9| Its not just the stuff he paid for, I mean its-its everything. Yknow? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didnt get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didnt believe in myself. 
 Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose? |2| It wasn’t my ring! It fell out of Ross’s jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing! 
  Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye-bye.  Oh God! |2| Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here... _B_ 
  Alright, the truth is, I soiled myselfduring some turbulences. |8| You don't need a shower. 
 Why? |4| I know! After you left the store I chose different ones. 
 Okay. |5| Most likely.  Okay, I'm gonna be out there. 
 That's what our friends call us. |2| So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D. 
 You're kidding! |2| She died. 
 Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area? |1| You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you. 
 I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . _B_ Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. _B_ That's actually good. _B_ |2| Chandler, Chandler. 
 We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less. |7| Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it. 
 What gay thing? |3| Well, ah, Im an actor. Im fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and dont worry Im totally okay with the gay thing. 
 Hello. |9|  Hey! 
  Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre? |8| Yes!! Yes!! Im the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up. 
 Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples. |0| He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it. 
 Yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules |5| And its not fake, its totally brutal. 
 Is it on? |5|  Oh-oh-oh-oh! 
 You mean like, music? _B_ |4| What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus its just, its so different from the stuff you usually hear. 
 Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night! |9| says $30 Father; same as in town.  _B_ 
  Okay.  But it is officially nighttime.  |2| Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative. 
 Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely." |2| No. 
 Look at us, were a couple of couples! |8| I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one! 
 Hey! Howd the audition go? |8|  Hey. 
 Oh, dont worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody. _B_ |6| I dont know, yknow? I feel a little umm No, yknow what? Never mind, Im gonna be fine. 
 Definitely roses.  Well, I just think theyre a little more weddingy.  But Lilies are the clear choice. |9| Yeah! Roses or Lilies?  
 Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it? _B_ |1| Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word.  Kind of what probably really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," yknow? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!" Yknow? You gotta take care of yourselves!  In this world history teaches us nothing!  
 Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.  _B_ Dr. |1| Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys? 
 Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically. |0| Why won't I be married when I'm 40? 
 Yeah! Anderson just scored again!  Theres no Anderson. |8| Is your team winning hon? 
 Why do you want to play this game so bad? |1| No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why dont you go home and wait for the thank you card? 
 I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey. |4| Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey... 
 Well Joey, Im a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin!  |5| I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler? 
 No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too. |5| Oh no, we have to! 
 Oh, Satan's minions at work again... |0| - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. 
 See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries. |0| You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you? 
 Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone! |1| Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot?  Oh! Secret teapot? 
 Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone! |1| Oh what, did someone outbid you for the teapot?  Oh! Secret teapot? 
 Work, Joe! |9| Thank you.  
 It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for. |9| So? What do you think of the house? 
 Mint! |6| Boss! 
 Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor. |9| _B_ Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections. 
 It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway.  Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday? |3| Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me. 
 Yeah, I know what youre thinkin! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.  |7| You mean like, music? _B_ 
 Oh, yknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel. |3| Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any thing serious. 
 Shhh, busy beaming with pride. Mrs. |9| Your mom was arrested? 
 And condoms are the way to do that? _B_ |7| You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth. 
 I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother.  I've done it again. |3| Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English. 
 Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job? |1| All right! Thanks Pheebs! 
  Hey! |8| On a totally different bet. 
 Id be sad sure, but I wouldnt cry. |0| Come on man theres gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy? 
  She was working on Valentines Day so were celebrating it tonight. |6| Well, Valentines Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldnt get her a calendar! 
 Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream. |8| I don't! 
 Lie!!! How hard is that?! The checks in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I cant wait to read your book, Ross!! |7| Well, she cornered me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?! 
 No. |4| Okay, Ill see you tomorrow!  Just so you know, were not seeing him tomorrow.  I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding? 
 And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose! |9| I guess. 
 Hey, I've been honing! |6| That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?! 
 Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay,five. A pack. Two pack...a...a carton. Three big fat cartons in twodays.  But it's over, I made a decision, I'm not gonnasmoke anymore. |1| What do I smell?  I smell smoke. Huh--did yousmoke? 
 Oh suddenly flowers are feminine? |2| well, no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me. 
 Bye bye.  |6| All right. Bye bye. 
 Let's do it, come on!  |3| Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma. 
 Hey, Rach, can I get... |6| Thank you. 
  Oh, this is not that bad. |1| God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totallynot worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that. 
 Hi. |8| Hi. 
 Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is? |0| ...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon. 
 Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.  |9| Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. Im totally cool with that. _B_ 
 Always illegal Joe. |6| Yeah, or-or to get a hooker. 
 Hey!  |8| No, but this wonder broom is amazing! 
 Come in! |6| Yeah, I know what youre thinkin! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.  
 And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club.  Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet. |7| Really? 
 Hi! |9| All right. Although I dont think we need one, I never stopped loving you.  
 Look, I-Im just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up Im moving right back in with you! |8| Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job.  Like youd believe that. This sucks! 
 So, thats it? |4| Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no. 
  Oh my God! _B_ |4| Oh my God! 
 Uh-huh! |1| Oh my God! Its like one mind. 
 Do you know what I was thinkin? |3| What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick. _B_ 
 No, no, no. |1| Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40? 
 OK Phoebs, how many do you want? |5| Congratulations!  
 Hey-hey. |4| Hey guys! 
 Hey babe. |8| Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry! _B_ 
 Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used. _B_ |4| Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her. 
 Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute!  Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?  |3|  Oh wait a second you guys for the last couple weeks Ive been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe hes the tea guy.  
 Yeah. |6| Okay, I got my note cards.  Do you got the presents? 
 Bogota. |0| Excellent! Lets play Bamboozled! Chandler, youll go first. What is the capital of Columbia? 
 Why? |4| Well then, you should look with us. 
  Yes? |7| Bye bye.  
 It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive. |0| Wha... what do you mean?  
 It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive. |0| Wha... what do you mean?  
 Well, aren't you a treat. _B_ |8| Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly. 
 What am I gonna do now? |0| Damn it!  
 And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps?  What were the things you said? |7| Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic? 
 I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out. |8| She's gone. 
 Oh yeah? |6| Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic.  Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one. 
 Hey. |8|  Hey. 
 _B_ Hhhiiii. |6| Who said it was for you? ROSS and 
 You know, we dont really take advantage of living in the city. |7| Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker. 
 Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else. _B_ |1| No. 
  All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once!  I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it. |5| Okay, get out of my kitchen! 
  Oh, by the way, that is her full name. |4| Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel? 
 Really? |5| Well okay, so then youre fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble. 
 Now why would she say that's embarrassing? |0|  ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man... 
  Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay? |6|  That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.  
 All right, great, road trip baby!  This okay with you? |8| Oh umm, not go. 
 I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler. |3| It's almost our anniversary! 
 So, uh, wh-where ya from? |4| I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name! 
 Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, Im rich! |3| Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me." 
 What do you think, shes just gonna sit there quietly? You dont think shes gonna want to make a toast? You dont think shes gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?! |6| Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it wont be so bad. 
 Well, either that or uh  |0| The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy! 
 Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again! |6| Hi! 
 Before we go out there Ive got a present for ya. |5| Thank you very much! Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing!  
 Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesnt it? _B_ |3| Thats because he wasnt invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party. 
  Yeah well, Im gonna go spit.  |4|  Im gonna go shave.  
 Well, what did she say? |3| I know! I know it’s awful. 
 Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours. |6| What was with the dishes? 
 But, those are for you. _B_ |6|  
 So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache? |1| Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler. 
 So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones! |5| Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first.  Thanks! 
 Why come all the way from Kansas to do that? |4|  Did someone drop the baton again? 
  I don't think that's exactly... |3| You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend? 
 Not yet. |5| Did you talk to him? 
 Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank? |1| I'm looking for Eddie Minowick. 
 Do I look fat? Ross and |8| Hey. 
 Oh! It's on! It's on!  |9| Oh my God! 
 Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles. |2|  Hey!  Oh God, is that Baywatch? 
 You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli. |7| Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah!  Enh? All right, what do you think? 
 Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at bigger rocks.  Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet? |9| Hey, I thought you already had one. 
 Which is why Asteroids is perfect! Its the oldest game! |9| I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques. 
 Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!  |5| Yeah but it wasnt for me, it was for a friend. 
 Nothing, I just like to go like this.  |5| What? 
  Would you put that back on?! Monicas gonna be here any minute! |1| Werent you asked to leave sonny? _B_ 
  Uh, uh. |0| What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriageable about me? 
  Monica! Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume |8| No, its me. Phoebe! 
 Who says you cant get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back? |2| Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they dont like us do they?  
  Hey! |8| What are they doing out here? The coasts all the way over there.  _B_ 
 What does a Wicked Wango card do? |5| Its Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card. 
 No, I have a great idea for a present for her. |5| Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas? 
 Ooh.  _B_ |8| Whatcha doin'? 
 Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it. |0| What, oh my God. What did you do? 
 Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it. |0| What, oh my God. What did you do? 
 He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own! |0| Just pass it to your boss! 
 And the fireplace in the bedroom. |9| Don’t you love the huge yard? 
 I said it first, bro. |5| Dude, I was gonna ask her out. 
 The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat. |1| What's the matter with you? 
 Yes because uh, you look so young. |3| You thought I was Rachel? 
 Who's Rick? |1| Who's Rick? 
 Hey, Mon. |9| Hey!  _B_ 
 it was like the Algonquin kids table.  _B_ The |3| Nooo!!  _B_ 
 Why dont you just give him to somebody else? |2| No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that ones actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense. 
 There we go little fella. |6| Oh! It's on! It's on!  
 Oh man! I am so excitedI may vomit! |0| Kidding! God, I feel wild today! _B_ 
 Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh!  |9| Okay, the last thing 
 Happy Anniversary, 10 months!  |8|  Hey! Happy Anniversary! 
 Thank you. |9| Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission.  You can go. 
 Huh. |5| Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler. 
 So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet? |7| Hey. 
 Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend  and her brother,  I cant do that we promised wed make each other gifts this year. |7| And of course, crotchless panties. 
 So it did go well. |3| Totally! 
 Yknow what? Its gonna be okay. Yknow what? Shes probably not gonna even want to come. |0| Oh my God, shes not gonna like the chicken that night either, is she?! 
  Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?  |8|  No! Drums! _B_ 
 I cant seem to say goodbye. |2| So just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem? 
 No? |6| Honey, Im going to put my hand in your pocket! 
 Does Ross know? |8|  She said yes. 
 mmm That's enough about you! |7| Actually, he is buying a much bigger place. It's got a great view of Central Pa..... 
 Wow. |7| Oh my god. 
 You don't like him. |5| Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!! 
 You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon! |3|  I don't get older. I just get better! 
 I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic. |2| Joey's gonna be *so* upset. 
 So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know. |1| Then, no.  
 Oh, oh, c'mon in. |0| Thanks. 
 I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group. |5| Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more. 
 Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow. |1| Noo. 
  Joe. Joe! Answer the phone. |7| I'm sorry, it just felt nice. 
 No, you didnt get me!! Its an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!! |8| Oh, Im sorry. Did I get ya? 
  Oh my God! |4| Chandler!! 
 Hey, gorgeous. |9| I'd like that. _B_ 
 No-no, hes not back yet, but hell be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern? |0| So is Joey around? 
 Oh yknow what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you. |0| So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but Im already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch. 
 Oh, yeah, sure, its not mine anyway. It can with the pants. |3| Umm,  I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me? 
 Yeah we do! |9| Yeah! 
 You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days... |4| Doy! Probably right before she lost it! 
 THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!! Jay |3|  ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken. 
 Okay, good luck with that.  |2| Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back. 
 I dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away! |5| What do you have against the beautiful guest room? 
 Oh, thats Parents Day, first grade. Thats me with the janitor Martin. |3| All right, whats going on there?  
 Will you marry me? Will you marry me?  Hey, you marry me!  Whats going on little elves? |7| See? Now, he could date her. _B_ 
 Uh why, do you have a lecture? |1|  Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight? 
 I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something. |2| Rosss apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often? 
  Okay, for the last time. Its not named for each individual man.  Mrs. |6| But it hurts my Joeys Apple. 
 Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!  _B_ |6| Well? 
 How about to the street say from the balcony? |5| No, it doesnt say where it came from. Where would we return it? 
 Higher or lower than what? |3| I should know that. Lets see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower. 
 Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"!! |3| Why, why would you open it? 
 Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"!! |3| Why, why would you open it? 
 That's good! I liked it, they didn't.  Joey, for God's sake, go to work! . |2| Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys. 
 This is bringing out a lovely color in you! |9| And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents! 
  Look, if you did... |1| Well, I thought it first, Holmes. 
 Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.  Mr. |0| Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.  
 Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods. |4| I'm tellin' you. You can't do this. 
 So, whaddya say boys, should I call him? _B_ Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question... you're going crazy. _B_ |5| _B_ I've never wanted you more. _B_ 
 Do I ever. |1| Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks. 
 Well the duck can swim. |2|  What about the duck? 
 Look you dont understand, Gandolf is amazing. Yknow youre never know whats gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia! |9| Will you calm down, hes just a human guy. 
 I got it! Scotch tape.  |6| No-no, not for like another two weeks. 
 So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight? |4| Noooo!! _B_ 
 Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie? |8| Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?" 
 Uhh, Joey's grandmother is right there.  |7| So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London 
 Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow! |2| I got you a present! 
 Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears? |4| So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right. 
 No! That was a lie! See how easy that was? |2| Really? 
 Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 800. Maitre d' I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir. |4| I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing. Maitre d' Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes. 
 Well Ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?! |5| Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more? 
 Shhhhhhhhh!!!  Im sorry, I thought maybe Id make some warm milk and it would help me sleep. |0|  I know, I wasnt finished.   But dont worry! Were gonna go down the fire escape!! _B_ 
 Ive been taking dancing lessons. |7| No. 
 The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white! |3| What?! I thought hed love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit! 
 You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them.  |6| See Chandler? Im getting a lot of use out of them already! Theyre very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants 
 Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much? |8|  Dude! What are yoyou trying to kill me?! _B_ _B_ 
 Well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything. |2| Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him? 
 If I help, we can find 'em faster! |0| Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why? 
 Alright! Just follow my lead!  |8| I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information. 
 And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality! |3| That's the door. He's gone... 
 Somebody is gonna pick us. |4| You don't know that. 
 God? |4| I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was? 
 Oh. |5| I'm Tilly. 
 NO! No, I'll take that for ya. MRS. |1| Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom? 
 Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her.... |2| Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it. 
 Oh, so you're divorced? |3| Ooooohhh. 
 Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight.  Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight. |4| Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater. 
 I do NOT want this unit!! |1| Calm down, do you want this unit or not? 
 Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, Im, Im smoking still. |5| Youre smoking again?! 
 No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake. |3|  Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um- 
 Yes, but theres two in martini, soo everybody back to my office. |6| So thanks for the warm welcome. Its good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, lets go out there and get em! Huh? And remember, there is no I in team. 
 I like it in the stern.  of the boat.   Hello. |9| I uh, dont really have a preference. You? 
 I dont know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office. |2| Really?! Wow! Thats-thats so nice, what are you gonna get me? 
 Oh well, thats uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure! |3| Hold on, yknow I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five? 
 Yknow, I cant believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on Im never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants! |2| Oh yay! _B_ 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact. |6| Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... 
 ...Dinah? |0| I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with... 
 Its a buffet man. |8| Where is the waitress?! Im starving! 
 No, Im not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.  _B_ |8| Are you mocking me? 
 Oh they didnt want to come! |6| Where were your parents? 
 Oh thats great! |9| Great! 
 Then free as a bird. Whats up? |7| No, why? 
 Which smells delicious! |9| That's my pie! 
 Is this because of the burrito thing? |3| Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 800. Maitre d' I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir. 
 Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I cant believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter!  And you! I cant believe that you would have a tux thats thirty years old!  Mr. |6|  Youve done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely. 
 Okay. How about in that cabinet? |3| Why dont we just find a place for it? 
  Can you believe how lame this is? |0| This is embarrassing.  
 No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple. |0| All the appliances are included. There is a lot of light, a new kitchen... I think you guys would be very happy here...  
 Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry. |1| What did it say? 
 Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry. |1| What did it say? 
 I don’t know. What do you think? |4| So? Do you think we should get it? 
 Totally. I had sex in High school... |2| Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want. 
 We don't know Bob! Okay? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy. |4| That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness. 
 You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil? |3|  Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat...as needed. _B_ 
 I know, this is a great apartment. |8| Can you believe this place? 
 Hey. |8| Hello. 
 No way! |4| Chris says theyre closing down the bar. 
 Because thats the only part of you he can see when hes on the table! |2| Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up. 
 Oh yeah, its beautiful country up there. |8| Really?! 
 Well, we used theres up last night making scary faces. |2| How did you know she would buy scotch tape? 
 Yeah, I know but |4| Yknow what, I dont know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend. 
  Hey Monica, here's your broom back. |7| Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire! 
 The one that doesn't. |2| Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't? 
 Okay.  |5| I know, but you have to open it today!  
 Why dont you open with a joke? |0| Ohh! Okay! Okay.  "There are three  primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.   Each of these theories  can be further subcategorized  into " 
 Yeah all right.  Okay, good night guys. |8| Nope-op! I insist!  You get the wine right? 
 Yeah. |6| You forget how many great songs Heart had. 
 Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups? |5| Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough? 
 Yeah, right here in my pocket.  Pheebs? |8| Yeah, yeah you have the ring? 
 Yes!! |8| So-so you wouldve just lied? 
  Yknow what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake. |5| It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling  Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva! 
 It got interesting! Damn you Oprah! |5| With a wok?  I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep. 
 Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us. |8| What?! No! It was my idea! 
 Nice try. |3|  Do you think he knew I was here?  _B_ 
 Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget. |5| What?! 
 No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!! |0| Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all. 
 I know its tough now, but things will get better. |3| So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but its not even like we know how to be with each other anymore. 
 All right!  Isn't this a woman's hat? |3|  Come on, it's fun! 
 If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass! |6| Oh, I like that. Yeah… 
 Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood! |8| What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set. 
 No. |4|  Damnit! anybody got anything? 
 Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family? |9| You guys have such a great place here. 
 I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing.  What, he's my favourite author! |9| Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks! 
  You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow. |3| Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!  
 Well, maybe it was God, doing me. |5| It was you, pal. 
 No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny. |1| The Ice Capades? 
 Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul. |6| I gather by that oh that he told you about me. 
 Hey. |8| Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself. _B_ 
 Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully? |0| No. 
 Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes. |3| What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice? 
 Fine!  _B_ |8| Well, you shouldve told me that before, Im not a mind reader. Hey, were out of beer. Im going to Monicas. 
 Look, Im telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place. |3| Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum? 
  And is this in case the house sneezes? |7| Well, maybe its so big because the house was built on radioactive waste. 
 So, uh... what do you think it is about me? |3| Oh! Okay! Phew! 
 Oh its Bing, sir. Im sorry , I was just ah... |0|  You! Chuckles! Whats your name? 
  Let it go!! _B_ |7|  Dude, Phoebes mom has got a huge peni... 
 What happened? |0|  Hey, its me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble. 
 Oh no-no-no, you dont want to do that, then youre gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets. |2| Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me. 
 Well, I dont really know what that is, but lets!! _B_ |4| Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens. 
 Yes. Right where? |5| You guys are really right there arent you? 
 Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice. |8| No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just? 
 This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone. Jay |5| Awww! 
 Listen, I gotta talk to you. |6| Oh, heres where I win all my money back!  
 Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight. |0| Hey, whats up? 
 Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey. |7|  Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, were gonna start with 
 Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut. |8|  Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun. 
 Oh my God! |4| Yeah-yeah, its down to me and two other guys. 
 What? |4| Uh-oh! Uh-oh! 
 Give him money? It was a joke! |0|  You need to give him money. 
 Ohh!  |8| Its older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo. 
 Yknow who has a great video camera? |8| Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake. 
 How about the closet by the bathroom?  |2| No! Thats where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation? 
  Why did you get me this? |1|  Ive still got it! 
 It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right? |0| What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler! 
 It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right? |0| What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler! 
 But you already gave all your money to charity! |1| Yay! 
 I do too. |9| I think we should. 
 All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg. |3| Me too. I'm good at it. 
 Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay. _B_ Mr |1| What if he reads it in the paper? 
 All right.  |5| Go over there and tell that woman the truth. 
 No, I got him. |3| It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all right? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby. 
 Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously. JOEY'S CO-|6| Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes. 
 Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today. |0| Hey! 
 Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now? |5| Yeah, apparently theyre turning it into some kinda coffee place. 
 Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now shes celebrating that by going on a date with him. |2| Monica, what are you doing? 
 If that doesnt keep kids in school, what will? |3| Ohhh.  
 Its not gonna be exactly like last time. |3|  Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit! 
 All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it. |3| Aww, man! 
 Are you serious? |2| Boy! I didnt see that coming! 
  I can't believe it! We're here! |7| I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better. _B_ 
 So you're really okay with this? |2| That's way uptown! That's like three trains away!  Which is great! I love to ride that rail! 
  Hello children! |9| And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality. 
 Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one? |0|  Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.  _B_ 
 Oh hey, how'd the interview go? |6| You are so cute.  _B_ 
 Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you? |4| That was some hot love you gave me! I'm gonna go get ready. 
 Your tax dollars? |1|  Yeah okay.  Even though my tax dollars paid for this car. 
 Wow! |8|  Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas! 
 Wait a minute, hold the phone! Youre not talking about Chuckles University?! |1| Open with a joke? Its a university, not a comedy club! 
 So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it. |6| You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard. 
 Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and shes gonna know. |3| Oh! Oop!  
 Yes!!! |8| Would it really have been that easy? 
 Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch? |2| Yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted. 
 Hey, yknow what we can do? Yknow, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, yknow like we did when we were first going out. Itd be fun! |6| Here, let me make the milk, Im up anyway. 
 We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva! _B_ |1| Does calling it not mean anything anymore?! 
 Look, Monica |0| Wait, wait, wait!  
 So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife? |6| Oh that is so sweet! 
 Im not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese? |6| How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we cant even be in the same room with each other?! 
 Yknow what, we have to turn off the porn. |1| Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!  _B_ 
 We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man!  You don't think he's here, do you?  |0| Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you? 
  That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack. |3| Uhm... no. Although I did have an uncle who voted for Dukakis. 
  "The Firm"? |0| Name one of his books. 
 Hey! |8| Hey! 
 Well, you owe me one, big guy. |6| Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you. 
 Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little... |8| He's kind of intense huh? 
 Ohhh _B_ Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one. |0| Hi. _B_ 
 Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do? |4| Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. 
 Okay, so you both just know this stuff? |4| And it works both ways. 
 So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket? |4| No, I'm still married. 
 Noo. |2| And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata? 
 Wow! Just like in the pros. |8| All right people listen, Ive got exactly twenty-eight minutes before I have to baste again. 
 Yeahhh. Im tellin ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time.... _B_ |7| Werent you nine?! 
 ...Quality, right, great. |3| I dunno, uh... you just have a-a... 
 Why cant you tell her? |3| We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that Ill be there as soon as I can. 
 Like? |7| Oh, thats not true! Ive got her lots of stuff she never took back. 
 Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking. |9| In the beginning where yknow its all sex and talking and sex and talking and 
 Monica and I almost got married last night. |6| Sure! Whats up?  
  "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice! |9| But youre still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.  
 Yes, but for the last time. |5| I thought you said you were going to do nothing. 
 No! Look, I dont cry! Its not a big deal! Okay?! |2| So that story doesnt make you cry? 
 I made a  |5| Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make? 
 Well, did-did you correct him? |2| Yeah and he didnt really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you. 
 Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money. |3| No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin you down. Everybody wants to be paid off. 
 Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!  Mr. |9|  Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! Shes coming! 
 Yknow I think we should invite them. |8| Well-wellsee? Parents are comin! 
  OK, so at this point, the dealer... |2| Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz... 
 Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile.  Its locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked? |3| Oh, okay. Here, why dont you let me do it? 
 Its yelling bleeding dilating. Oh, the dilating |4| What is it? 
 Honey, we’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way. |3| I want a baby. 
 What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that. _B_ |5| Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.  
 I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking. |4| What is this?! 
 Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...! _B_ |5| NO! I don't!! 
 Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...! _B_ |5| NO! I don't!! 
  Bye! |7|  Yeah, we had a great time, thank you!  
 I don’t think you can do that! |7| Well, I’ll just ask for it back! 
 I know. |5| This is huge! 
 All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with. |2| You got it. 
 Hi. |8| Go.  
 Oh, seriously you want him? |0| No, seriously. 
 Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up. |1| _B_ I'll survive. _B_ 
 Yeah well, I hear the place looks great. |7| Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing. 
  Can I get a beer. |6| Got me. 
 Oh thats great, with my luck, thats gonna be him. |6| Yeahhh. Im tellin ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time.... _B_ 
 What are you talking about? |5| Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans. 
 I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped. |1| C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! 
 ...And then he burst into flames. _B_ |4|  Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.  
 Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere. |8| Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that! 
 Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.  |6| Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time! 
 What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table! |1| That's the rule. 
 Okay. |5| That's a great idea! I was saving them for something special. 
  Wow! That sandwich really does smell good. |9| Yeah, okay. _B_ 
 Do we have to? |3| For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary. 
 I can save you time ladies, Im right here. |2| Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet. 
  Hey. |8| Oh dear God, let me think.  
 Oh thats so funny because we found someone too. |8| Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing. 
 Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh? |0| Okay that does sound like fun. 
 This is not going to work. |2| Look!  
 Lets call em. |5| Do you still wanna call em? I wanna call em. 
 How is that me? |5| Yes I did! Im Chandler.  Dude, what happened? 
 Rachel lost Marcel. |9| Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative? 
 Lets just say if I cant find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one. |4| Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case? 
 All right, ready? |6| I think youre right.  
  Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God! |2| You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see...  Yeah, I could see it. 
 Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys.  Hey, Steve. |3|  Hello? Hold on. It's your boss. 
 You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year. |6| Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready... 
 Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . . _B_ |5|  Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk.  Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here? 
 Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie. |3| _B_ A little what? 
 Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now. |1| Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back. 
 Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan? |4| Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan. 
 No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my |1| You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you. 
 Its possible. You are very loveable, Id miss you if I broke up with you.  I was just trying to be supportive. |2| Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks. 
 Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with? |0| Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple. 
 All right buddy, way to go!  |6| Yes!! 
 Joey! Joey!! |1| Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to 
 When was the last time you saw her wear it? |5| Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year. 
 Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! |8| Whoa-whoa-whoa! 
 All right, we havent had sex yet. Okay, whats the big deal? Yknow? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level. |1| And the sex? 
 Hey! |8| Hey! 
 Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... |9| Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! 
 Hey. |8| Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.  
 Look, I just dont think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Yknow? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Yknow? And, how do I tell her without crushing her? |8| Oh my God! Thats huge!  Wait a minute, why come I wasnt invited? And who was going to be your best man? Dont say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross." 
 Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben.  Do you know what Pheebs? When youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.  |9| Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, its going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler. 
 That's OK. |4| By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads. 
 And monkeys cant write out prescriptions.  |8| What, you didnt get it? The doctor is a monkey.  
 Nothing! |2| What is that? 
 Oh-oh, what are you doing? |9| Oh, I love that guy!  
  You are beautiful. |9| Hi guys. 
 Hey, I can be smooth.  Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.  Maitre d' Of course, sir. |9| You've got to be smooth about it. 
  Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out whats going on.  |1| Crap.  
 Alright, what have we learned so far?  The Whole |5| What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors,  cute doctors, doctors who are cute! 
 Well this is just sad! |1| Oh please, you just want more blue pins. 
 I dont know, its these new shoes, theyre all slippery. |6| Whats the matter? 
 Oh yknow, Ive been living here a while and Ive never seen whats inside that closet. What is, what is in there? |7| No reason. I-I keep private things in there. 
 I thought maybe you got me porn for Valentines Day. |1| Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebes. Why were you even watching it? 
 I’m so tired.  Yeah okay, but no foreplay. |0| Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it’ll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet’s still available? 
 And this- is my reward! |9| Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years! 
 He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it...  |6| Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere? 
 That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady. _B_ |4| Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids! 
 I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day. |4| How bad you wanna smoke, right now. 
 Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway. |4| Those are the pacts! 
 I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled.  I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place! Joey  You know, I had a chance to stop her too! |2| Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel? 
 Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something. |2| Hi. 
 Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery? RACHEL AND |8| I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like. 
 I'll cancel the sodas. _B_ |2| What if we have to pee? 
 Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest. |9| Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin' 
 Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again? |3| So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place. 
 That's easy, baggage claim. |4| Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do? 
 You betcha! |8| Hey, did you pick a roommate? 
 Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.  |4| Him? Him, Ross? 
 So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen. |5| Okay, good bye!  _B_ 
 I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped! _B_ |0| Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history! 
 Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!  |9| Come here.  Okay, be right back.  
 Nice! |8| I just asked that girl out. 
 Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio |2| How'd you get to that? 
 So what happened? |0| No! 
 I can't smell your sandwich? |2| Did I say you could smell it?! 
 Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there. |5| No. 
  You are not allowed to laugh at my joke. |0| And monkeys cant write out prescriptions.  
 Why would our guy be a weirdo? |2| Oh thats good, I guess shell have a choice between my guy and your weirdo. 
 And  to you too, Helen. |9| Absolutely.  So, twins... hah! Thats like two births.  Ouch. _B_  
 Okay.  |5| Hey, I can be smooth.  Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.  Maitre d' Of course, sir. 
  No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading. |1| The second sister dies?! 
 You are so great! I love you!  |9| I bet this will work!  
 Oh hey. Id shake your hand but uh; Im really into the game. Plus, I think itd be better for my ego if we didnt stand right next to each other. |3| Hey. 
 In the James Taylor case. |6| Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD? 
 Two. |6| One. 
 There's a tape here with Monica's name on it. |2| What? 
 Yeah.... she's not so cute. |5| Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look like"  
 Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks! |1| Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant. 
 I just feel awful. |0| Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career! 
 I just feel awful. |0| Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career! 
 I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile". |5| Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do. 
 Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no. |0| No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is? 
 Your boyfriend is so cool. |8| So'd you guys have fun? 
  If I broke up with you, Id miss you. _B_ |0| Then be supportive like a guy. 
 Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll. |2| What? He's cute! 
 Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal. |2|  Dude, what are you doing? 
 I thought your time ran out. |0| Yeah? 
 Big dog? _B_ |0| Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh 
 And now youre giving me the message! |8| So uh, Emily called last night 
 Forget it! Okay, Im not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats! |6| What do you say? 
 Boys? We're going in.  |0|  I just... can't do it. 
 Really? |5| Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you! 
 What?! |3| Oh! Tell her shes not marriage material. 
 See thats where I think that youre wrong. Weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense. |3| Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies. 
 Unbelievable |3| Thank you for bringing her into our lives. 
 What? Thats terrible! |0| We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica. 
 Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny." Monica's |1| Oh no! Whats the matter? 
 Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for? |3| So what are you gonna do? 
 Hows your room Rach? |9| Oh, its bad. Its really bad. The only thing in there that isnt burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying! 
 Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue! |1| Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch! 
 Hey-hey are you drunk? |5| Heyyy!! You got the door open!!  
 Not well.  |3| Well, are you going to be able to do this? 
 OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson.  Joey... three... eight. Eight... three.  Alright babe, deal the cards.  |0| But... I'm ready, so, just deal. 
 When have I ever done that?! |5|  That is so you! 
 Dont try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff! |7| Feminine stuff. 
 Well, Im not really in a sexy mood right now. |6| Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentines Day  you were right! Apparently, its about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts!  Oh, wait a minute. Those arent stars. Anyway, you want to take a look? 
 This is so exciting! Its so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look? |8| No ones here!  Oh damnit! _B_ 
 Okay, so this time I won't quit! |2| Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit. 
 You got it! |9| Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him? 
 We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing. |0| Gotcha. When do we tell them about this? 
 Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact. |5| Oh, oh... maybe not you! _B_ 
 Heh. |8| Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet. 
 Whoever stood you up is a jerk. |8| Yes? 
 Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me? |1| And who is this little cutie pie? 
 Well, she looks the exact opposite of that. |0| Yeah. 
 Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey. |6| Oh, well great. 
 Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something. |3|  Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her. 
 So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend? |1| What?! 
 Um-mm, yeah right! |5| Is it the Italian guy? 
 Okay, so I guess thats about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in. |1| Umm, oh, about three months. 
 Okay, okay, but dont worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which Im fairly certain are the same thing. |3| No-no, stay right there.  Gettin closer. 
 Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River. |6| Oh boy, I just love to sing! 
 Too many jokes... must mock Joey! |2| Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.  
  Oh dear God, they gave us glasses! |1| We're switching rooms. 
 Arghhhhhh!!  |1| Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!  
 Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination. |3| You knew about that? 
 Okay, I'll give them back.  Look! What is so great about that sandwich? |1| Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness! 
 Yeah, I think we should see other people. |4| Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary! 
  What?  What? |1| I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents?  Why do they have to become people? Why do they have...  Why can't you stop staring at my breasts? 
  What? What can't you do? |0|  We can't do that. 
 So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money. |0| Your joke? Well, I think the Hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars. 
 Well, it is overdue. |7| Im just so nervous! Yknow? The callback isnt until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode! 
 Who are you going out with? |6| OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma? 
 Okay.  The |4|  Great! Thats great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile? 
 Oh, okay. Send her in.  |3|  Nina Bookbinder is here to see you. 
 Had the money in the wrong hand.  _B_ |1| How did it go? 
 Thats correct. _B_ |4| The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest? 
 Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking! |1| What? 
 What the fuck are you doing?! _B_ |7| Noo! I came down here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.  
 Honey, Im gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case. |2| Where is the James Taylor CD? 
 Get there faster!  _B_ |6| Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape...  Wait a minute... This says Monica...  And this is Richard's apartment...  
 OK, Pheebs, your turn. |9| No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do. 
 Me, that guy who just said butt cracks? |4| Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. We're offering you the position of junior copywriter. 
 Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but...  you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her...  |5| Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament! 
 Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but...  you know, you and Monica have the same "I'm gonna kill you" look...? I can usually make it go away by kissing her...  |5| Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament! 
 Tell me more. |5| Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it. 
 Yes, Joe? |5| Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose.  Wait a minute... 
 He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever. |0| Go-go-go-go, come on!   So uh, what did you find out? 
 Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap |0| Have you ever seen so much crap? 
 Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15. |3| Really? 
 Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area. |5| Right this is staging. 
 I know, that,  that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid. |0| What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away? 
 No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him. |0| Is Brian...? 
 Well, I didnt do anything. I didnt want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom. |1| Yeesh, whatd you do about it? 
  Uhh, that was Joey. Hes running a little late, he says hes sorry. |3| Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more 
  Hello.   Its Gandolf!!!  So, are you in town?   Oh, well, well maybe next time then.  |7| Okay.  
 No, hes right, Im totally lying.  |2| Why? Just because youre not mature enough to understand something like that?! 
  Elizabeth Hornswoggle? |4| Yes it is. See.  
 Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things.  Are you okay? |1|  Yeah the material feels so softhello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out? 
 I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And yknow Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around  |8| What do you mean? 
 Hey, look at all the boxes! |4| Oh, so you like her too Chandler? 
 Oh well, that makes it not terrible. |0| No-no, we do it every year! 
 Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents! |8| Nooo!  Okay.  Whoa!  Okay. See I was, I was a little nervous about turning  thirty.  So the bus boys took me out for some drinks.  I wanna puke on you later! 
 Here you go.  |7|  Uh sorry, wrong number.  
  Hey! |8|  Hey! 
 Fine. |6| Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-youll let it go. 
 Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws? |5| Honey, whats going on? 
 Yeah, thats kinda a relief. |7| Thats kinda nice. 
 What? |4| A little tall. 
 Yep. Ms. |6| Ok if everyone’s on board, it’s settled, Chandler,  Chandler? 
 All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.  |6| Ohhh! Put it out! 
 You'll get one. |7| No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two? 
 I know. Gooooood luck with it. _B_ |8| Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard. 
 Your hands are shaking. |5| Thank you.  All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college? 
 Forget about her. |4| Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!? 
 I don't know.  I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?  |3| How did you... 
 Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore. |0| And she's not crazy? 
 _B_ Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK. _B_ MR. |2| Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen. 
 That's right my friend. It's time for... |6| Well OK then. _B_ Was that the oven timer? 
 Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through? |2|  Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel. 
 ...Hm. |6| I suppose mainly sexual. 
 Oh yes, and thats what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one. |4| Hes so cute. 
 Hey, shut up!! Youre not my real Mom!! _B_ |6| Chandler! Youre smoking? What are you doing?! 
 Hey! |8|  Hey!! 
  Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a very serious relationship |3| Oh, look at us! Who wouldve thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.  
 Aah, y'killing me!  |7| Nice shoes, huh?  
 No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time. |6| Have you even had a girl up here? 
 Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!  _B_ |2| No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change.  Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we? 
 I'm over here big guy. |3|  It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha! 
 What do you mean, like, buy it together? |2| Ok, ok, How about if we split it? 
 Yeah, it is the best. |8| I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit! 
 Okay. |5| Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had. 
 Yes. |6| But we can go, right? 
 Hes at a dinner party. |9| Its almost 8 oclock, its almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he? 
 Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke. |1| Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think Ill show the sexy teller that I am a published writer. 
 Oh no problem, maybe Ill play with my left hand. |1| He hates to lose. 
 No, I am. |3| Im sorry, is the seat uncomfortable? 
 Hi, Nina. Come on in. |7| Hi. 
 No I didn't! |1| You said you loved me! I can't believe this! 
 Well, if were gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Yknow alphabetically or by genre? |3| Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, were just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases. 
 Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow .  |9| Yes, that's right. We're excited about the level of sophistication you'll be bringing to the job. 
 You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!  |7| Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these  Not with soap!!  
 You have to really wanna see it. _B_ |3| How is that the silver lining? 
 ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!  |4|  Look, look, I have elbows!  _B_ 
 Bye. _B_ |7| Bye-bye. 
 Alright you guys are off to party number one _B_ and you, you are off to party number two _B_ Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin. |8| _B_ This is clearly in the wrong apartment. _B_ _B_ 
 Hello-dillillio!! |6| Chandler! 
 Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not. _B_ |2| Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league. 
 Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty. |7| Y'know what, I like Kathy. 
 So I guess its just uh, you and me then. |3| Oh. 
 Hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in Chicago. |3| What happened? 
 Well, Kathys last boyfriend was Joey. |5| Then what is it? 
 Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken. Mrs. |7| I am famished. What do I want...  
 Horn-swoggle. |6| That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle. 
 Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything. |3| Well, if you really wanna know, I'mOh! I can't tell you this. 
 Y'know, I don't see that happening? |1| Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee. 
 Okay, Im a rookie. I should not be in the end zone. _B_ |2| That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping. 
 Tell me it's "you and me" we. |8| Uh, we might be leaving now. 
  This, this actually is a  |4| Now, its you little bunny friend.  _B_ 
 Thats sweet. |8| Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today when I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she she wished me good luck. 
 Yes! |8| Noo!!! 
 Well, thanks a lot for hookin me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest. |6|  So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if theres anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all.  But these are the three that Monica pre-approved. 
  I dont think you did a very thorough job! |9| Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school 
  Love you. |9| Thank you!  
 How long it took to go back in the water? |2| Mm-hmm. 
 You wanna see if we still have it? |3| Yeah.  
 Its just so glamorous. _B_ |6| Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller?  There you go.  
  Yes. Ms. |6| Are you on board? 
 What?  Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter. |0| Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow .  
 You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness  |1| Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny... 
 All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one? |0| Oh yeah? When? 
 Course there, they just call it food. |3| He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food. 
 No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.  _B_ |8| Thanks. 
 It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date. |7| It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal. 
 So, we gettin' a fish? |4| Bye. _B_ 
 You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car _B_. |9| Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. _B_ Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats _B_. 
 What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story? |1| Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out. 
 Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!  |0| Hey, you know about that?! 
 Okay, but after that, were shootin some pool. |1| Oh look, the pool tables free. Rack em up. Ill be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt. 
 Okay.  Its a chicken. |5| I got you something! Open it! Open it! 
 I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.  |6| Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say. 
 Right! I just think that this is happening too soon. |3| I know! And Im just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be! 
 You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan? |4| "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great." 
  You did look like an idiot. |2|  Yeah, you are!  I scared you! Present Day _B_ 
 You think we're ready for something like that? |4| Yeah 
 Well you coulda tried, not kissing him. |1| Well, I didn't know what else to do! 
 Yeah. |6| Are you thinking about Monica? 
 It's a great idea.  |7| Okay! 
 Thats the way I did it til I was 19. _B_ |3| I-I-I dont even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Yknow what? Im just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks. 
 No not okay, you cant look for Monicas presents! |5| Dont worry, were just gonna search here for an hour, them were gonna go over to Joeys and search, OK? 
 Yeah! |8| Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there? 
 A face ass? |5| My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these  
  Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy! _B_ |0| Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs. _B_ _B_ 
 Does anybody know me?!  |3| Youre not a lefty? 
 I do?  |2| Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile. 
 Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers. |1| You wanted to see me? 
 No I didn't! |1| Yes, you did! 
 My God! You must be good in bed! |5| Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!  
 Im watching the game, but Im not deaf! |4| Well you look incredible too! Youre justyoure so fit! 
 Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room. |4| Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go? 
  Hey Phoebe!  Fatty! |8| Is that a real place?  Are they hiring? 
 See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes.  Me. |8| Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice. 
 We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes. |6| Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!  
 Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac. |1| Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this. 
 I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant. |2| Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer? 
 Ok, they're coming, shhh. _B_ |5| Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? _B_ Alright that's Ross. 
 Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase. |5| I-I know. Well if something comes up...  
 Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between em. |7| Y'know I dont, I dont understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin her boob. 
 All right, theres a nuclear holocaust, Im the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me? |2| I know.  _B_ 
 She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what? |7| Yeah, she's... 
 Yeah, I think it is! |9| Oh, okay. 
 Stupid, useless Canadian money! _B_ Mr. |0| Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky! 
 No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him. |7| And youre afraid you wont be able to fill his shoes. 
  Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please? |2| Come on! 
 Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little. |3| Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think? 
 Love what you've done with the place. |8|  Hey roomies! 
 No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.  |1| You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name? 
 What's going on? |2| Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most. 
  Hi. |8| Good! Good! I was just testing you. 
 Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'  |5| C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat. 
 Hey. |8| Thats the way I did it til I was 19. _B_ 
 All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket? |0| Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her. 
 Ok, you can not do this to me. |3| She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it. 
 Was his question whats more boring than him? |0| Bye-bye.  Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut.  
 Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentines Day gifts? |7|  Hey! 
 Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman? Fireman #1 Well uh, do either of you smoke? |4|  Yes, they can stay with us. 
 Ross! |7| Ross!! 
 So uh, what did this woman look like? |0| No, its more like a  good luck. 
 Yes!! |8| Noo!! 
  "Happy Birthday Peehe." |8| Oh... 
  Well, whats the deal with these? These-these look nice. |4| Im Monicas maid of honor. Okay? Dont try to blue pin me! 
 What? |4|  I dont think this numbers right!  
 Hey. |8| Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good? _B_ 
 Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years.  If! I said, "If it helps!"  |8|  Hello Chandler, lovely day huh?  You! 
 You dont know. You didnt see it. |8| Chandler, we cant let this tape wreck Valentines Day! 
 FREE PORN!!! |1| Yeah.  
 Yeah? |7| Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey? 
 Yes dear. |8| We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that! 
 Sure! Alright... |5| Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else? Monica & 
 Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically. |0| Why won't I be married when I'm 40? 
 This is like figure skating team all over again.  I mean synchronized swimming.  I mean- I mean the balance beam.  Help me! |1| Oh, man! 
 Yuh-huh. |6| Nuh-uh. 
 I think they get it. |8| No problem. Hey Chandler 
 Thank you Rachel. |9| Good luck Chandler. 
 Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good |3| Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this? 
 Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here? |1|  Where there is no fear of commitment. 
  Take off your shirt!  |9|  Stick out your tongue. 
 Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window. |0| Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. Its been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks. 
  Hello, children! |7| Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph? 
 I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas! |8| Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time. 
 Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? |6| Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.  
 Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out? |2| Why not? 
 Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke. |7| Yeah, I can do that. 
 Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our  anniversary. |9| Okay, I'm gonna go too! 
 No, you dont have to, and you cant because I live here too. |8| But we have to! 
 Okay .  |4| Well, Im not going to go now anyway . 
 And he's not speaking metaphorically. |2| Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey. 
 Okay.  |5| Yeah!  All right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try umm, try looking sexy. 
 Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack. |1| Which is bad, because? 
 Joey! Joe!  Full bag.  Beers still cold. Something terrible mustve happened here!  Oh no-no-no-no-no-no!  Stevie, I was never here!  _B_ |0| No.  Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner? _B_ 
 No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!  _B_ |1| You love me! 
  What? |4|  Soul mate. 
 Well, I got a job interview. Its kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and Id be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring. |2| Hey Chandler, why so fancy? 
 And, a lemon lime. |5| You got me a cola drink? 
 Does that mean I get the good loving tonight? |6| Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you! 
 Why not? |4| No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you. 
 Well, we are great guys. |8| I think it's great you guys are doing this. 
 Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Bleeth? |7| Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Bleeth. 
 Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin out the Chan-Chan man! |7| Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you... 
 Fowl? No. Women? Nooo. |2| Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks? 
 Ive got canned goods. |5| Ennnh. 
 No, I don't. |1| You love her. 
 Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut |3| So what did you do today? 
 Yes, and I was saying the actual words. |3| Yeah, I was going for the metaphor. 
 Hi! Hi! Youre crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight. |9| No, but Im gonna! 
 Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you. |3| I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces... 
 Hey!  |8| Hey! 
 Yes, you got something from the Screen Actors Guild. |5| Hey! Any good mail? 
 Hey! |8|  Hey guys! 
 Now imagine you live at the supermarket. |6| Oh God, yeah. 
 Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride. |1| Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money? 
 Do we have to make the entire thing? |2| Oh, yeah. 
 No-no-no-no.  Hey!  |5| Okay, hold on just a second.  Im sorry, its for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please? _B_ 
 Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror? |4| She was like 30, dark hair, attractive. 
 Okay, heres the thing. Were gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that youre drunk. |2| Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk!  That they know of. 
 You mean like for award shows? |6| Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when theyre done with them they just send em back. 
 Yknow I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here? |0| No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!  _B_ 
 Sex on the balcony? |4| Boy, do I have a surprise for you! 
 Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful?  |9| Child-birth, its a natural thing! Its beautiful. 
 We have free porn here!!! _B_ |0| Yeah!! 
 Okay. |5| Listen uh, I-Ive been doing some thinking, and I dont know whether its because were here or Rachels giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby. 
 I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child? |5| Ravioli's delicious! 
 No, no, no. |1| Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40? 
 Oh my God! |4| Oh. 
 Thank you. |9| FOOTBALL! 
 Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty? |3| So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what? 
 There's the man. |1| Ok. _B_ 
 The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.  |4| Break.  
  Have I got the 50 guys for you! |2| Hey! 
 No! No! Not, Paris. |1| Oh no! Where to?  Too Paris? 
 Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?  |5| You really didnt know? _B_ 
 Forget it! Okay, Im not giving up the apartment. |4| Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means? 
 I know I am. Mrs. |5| Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug.  Well, I think we're ready for some tequila. 
 Oh yeah! |8| Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don'tI was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine. 
 Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani! |9| Hey!  
 Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny. |6| You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute? 
 I'm not moving out. |8| Why, are you moving out? 
 Oh, I wish Id know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese. |1| Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates. 
 Why? |4| Well then, you should look with us. 
 No, our guy is just a floating head. |3| Have you seen your guys body? 
 WENUS.  Weekly Estimated Net... |9| Your... excuse me? 
 Rach, Rach, we gotta settle. |4| Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
 Me! I do that. So Seriously, do I look okay? Im little nervous. |3| Wait, I think I know someone who does that. 
 And last but not least.  |7| Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater. 
 What?! |3| Oh, because, you know... they don't like you. 
 That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey! |4| I don't know.  
 I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice. _B_ |5| We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.  
 Yes, Bunny? |4| Peach pit. 
 See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind. _B_ |6| Hey, hey, they're runnin' 
 You think? |7| Amazingly, that makes sense. 
 Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make. |4| Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka. 
 Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. Ill do it. |5|  That was  surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all? 
 Excellent hole, Joe.  |9|  Hey, you guys! Take a look at this!  Check this baby out, dug me a hole! 
 and then it got canceled. |2|  Oh, it looks great! 
 We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot. |6| So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed. 
 Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie. _B_ |0| Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me. 
  "Benefits lapsed." |6| Ooh, its probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, Im kinda . 
 No-no |4|  Okay! 
 I hope she throws up on you.  |5| I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler. 
 Ehh. |3| Really? 
 Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up. |7| Yes! Why, did youyou forget to make yours? 
 God, its great to catch up! I cant believe how long its been! |8| Okay Phoebe calm down, theres no need to place blame. Okay?  I warned her about those candles. _B_ 
 No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive  Hold on one second; let me check this out.  Okay uh, is that her?  |1| Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college? 
  Am not! _B_ |3|  Oh and Chandlers about to cry. 
 Yeah, Ill take care of it. |9| Really?! You promise? 
 Hey! |8| I dont know.  A cowboy theme? _B_ 
 You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "Who are you wearing?! You look fabulous!" |3| Some of them. 
 Well, what if all my stuff was here? |1| Then all your stuff would be here. 
 Whats this? |3| Here!  
 Shes okay with Rachel and the baby? |5| Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh! 
 What is it? |4| No, but someones really not going to get over that idea, are they? 
 See, honey, theres |0| Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me! 
 Okay. Ive been thinking about it too, and I, I think were ready. |6|  What-what-whats that now?! 
 Thanks, man. |9|  Hey, that is so great about the job. 
  Uh, uh. |0| What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me? 
 Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles. |5| All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move! 
 Oh, and uh, the fabric softener? |0|  No. 
 Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers. |5|  Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do. 
 Sorry. Im sorry. Y'know what, were just gonna throw it.  |0| Oww!! Son of a...!! Ow! Come on! 
 Easy Lenny. _B_ |8| Oh, well no problem there.  
 Thank you, Ross. |9| Come on, Pheebs lay off him. 
 Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! Theyre buying me drinks! Theyre giving me stuff!  Knicks tonight? |6| Really?! 
 Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. Thats right, yes, Im being transferred to Yemen! |1|Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona? 
 Like what?  |4| Uhh, because Im trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick hes looking over here, say something funny. 
 Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say. |8| Okay, now you're even cuter!! 
 Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip... |7| You'd tell me if you were moving out right 
 Hey!  |8| Hey! 
  Oh, good. Rog is here. |7| C'mon up. 
 Shocking! Since you still have the keys. |5| Hey babies! Oh, Im having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche Ive got the keys too, still there! 
 Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money? |4| Oh thats okay. Hey, actually in a way its kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!  
 No, I have a great idea for a present for her. |5| Chandler, arent you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas? 
 So... |5| I hope she throws up on you.  
 Theres a Mr. Bing! |1|  Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens? 
 Dont worry about it Pheebs. |9| Oh, we have to get you an engagement present? 
 Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering? |7|  Hey sweetie. 
 Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that... shes really really cute. |7| Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Wont happen again. I wouldnt want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."  _B_ 
 I dont know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions. |9| They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that? 
 The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so... |7| Settle what? 
 They were just giving those away at the store  in exchange for money. |0| Good.  Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really? 
 What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry. |3| No. Not after what happened with Steve. 
 Noho. Who doesn't they like me? |6| I thought you knew that. 
  We're teeth people Zack! _B_ |0| Yess!!  
 Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys... |8| Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that? 
  Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances." |3| Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why? 
 Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way. _B_ |0| Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind! 
 Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice? |5| Oh, its just like a bloodbath in here today. _B_ 
 Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there? |0| Hey, dont call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry! _B_ 
  What if Joey were president?  |3| Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell.  Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad? 
 Yes.  Yes! |9| Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong. 
 Really?! You do that? |4| Well, I could cut it. 
 Yeah? |7| Sweetie, with you its gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love. 
 I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. |3| What does she mean by 'involved'? 
 Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians. |4| Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story. 
 Okay, its not a check. Theyre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnt work enough last year. |0| Hmm thats weird. I dont remember being in a move called benefits lapsed. 
  What? |4| Okay.  Okay, I cant wait! This is going to be the best Valentines Day ever!  I cant believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents! 
  Oh thats great! Good for you. |9| Chandler, is that  
 Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend. |8| Oh my God yes! Who is she? 
 Dont worry, Im brave! I am brave! I I am brave!  No-no-no-no!!   Can you tell me who is there please? The |8|  Who is that?! 
  Okay we have to do something about your breath. |4| Okay. I love you so much.  
 Yknow Im-Im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding. |6| Hey! 
 Okay, who wore those?  |4| Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!? 
 Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what Im saying? _B_  |5| Then youd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesnt make any sense. 
 Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowersThink of the money well save!!  Were not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please? |5| Its your suitcase. Were going to Las Vegas. 
 See? I told you. |5| Okay.  
 Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that youre going down the same path, but youre really going down different ones. |5| Well I I havent actually told her yet. I dont want to scare her off, yknow? 
 Honey, I dont like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony? |5| I drew you a bath! 
 Why not? |4| Yeah, just dont get your hopes up. 
 Really? What? |4| And I like to think I had a little something to do with it. 
 Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!   |6| Well? 
 Monica. Calm, self. |8| Everyone. Erica, baby! 
  Ooooh.  |7| Like the three musketeers, only with fruit. 
 There you go. _B_ |6| Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way. 
 Yeah.  |6| Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here.  Okay, you're in bed... 
 Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball. |0| Im serious, I really, I think I need just to have some...meaningless, sex y'know, with the next guy that I see.  
 Oh my God! Oh my God! |3| They have the best stuff in there. _B_ 
 All right. |5| Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love. 
 Wherever! Ive got like 20! |9| Sure! Where are the seats? 
 I dont know exactly. |5| When? 
 I said, "Like what?" |0| What-what-what is so funny? 
 Oh my God! |4| Hey! 
 The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me. |1| What? 
 It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly. |3| Aw, I know all about Kip! 
 Yeah, I wanna go to babe. |0| Oh good! 
 Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or |5| What? 
 What equity investments? |4| You should see the treatment I get when Im with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments. 
 Yes it would. What do you say to $50? |2| What, are you crazy? You havent beaten me once since my injury plagued 97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money. 
 Oh, what a crappy night! |1| Just us. 
  Wait! You look? You-you massaged me. |9| Oh yeah, like there are police for that! 
 Secret? Married people arent supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another. |5| I cant tell you. Its a secret. 
 Huh! Where is the dog?! |0| Ohio!! Thank you! _B_ 
 Did you see Betty?  _B_ Mr. |5|  oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi!  You found Betty! Oh my god!  This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room,  Where's Joey?  
 What are you talking about? |5| Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone. 
  I don’t... uh... understand. |6| Hey, finished my recommendation.  Here. And I think you’ll be very, very happy. It’s the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn. 
 Hmm, the game's at one. |5| Did I do something to you? 
 April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent. |5| Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too. 
  Could've been a peach. |7| Actually, nectarines, but basically... 
 Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? _B_ Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? _B_ OK, that's my bad. |8| Oh. _B_ 
 Janices birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me. |6| Id really prefer a mountain bike. 
 What time is it now? |5| Uh, 1030. 
 No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts! |0| One more time, "Hey, dont you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?" 
 Dog grooming huh? Okay, just dont make my tail too poofy. _B_ |0| Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunts dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say? 
 Oh, the tears are real. _B_ |7|  You're fake laughing too, right? 
  Sounds like a fun party. |9| so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles. 
 Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy. |0| Yeah. 
 All right. |5| Let me see that! 
 If I help, we can find em faster! |1| Chandler, thats not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And youve just gotten her one great present? I mean thats just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why? 
 Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm  Can you hold for one second please?  What?! |4| Hey-hey listen  
 An old cookie? |6| Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.  
  No, were still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her. |3| Did you break up with her? 
 Thats still yours. Okay, now remember its a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised. |7| What about your breath?!  
 No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together. |3| So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet? 
 Yknow I was thinking if we had a a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours |3| Oh boy, me too! 
 Not bad. |2| Umm, well lets see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw. 
 Oh my God.  |4| You wanted it to be a surprise.  
 Yknow we already went over this and I won! |4| Were going to Las Vegas to see your dad. Its time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law. 
  What? |4| She stole my jeans! 
  Yknow, its been a while since weve screamed something. Maybe we should. |3| Yeah, I hated her. She was horrible to me in high school. But hey, it was a long time ago, Im in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. You got any cakes or cookies or something?  No Will no! 
 Well, this does butch it up a bit. |4| Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So its a boy bath! 
 Whats wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?  On a barbecue chicken pizza?  No? |9| Not really. 
 What about it? |3| Well, the interview 
 But you said you were ready too. |8| Youre ready to have a baby? My boys all grown up! 
 Can I use your phone? |6| I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.  _B_ 
  Oh yeah?  Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out. |9| Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job. 
 Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.  |2| Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong? 
 Yeah. |6| I'm gonna use the cushion. 
  And now Ive picked it up again.  |8| Yeah, so? 
 Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?! |4| Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!! 
 All right. |5| Ohh! 
 Yknow what, Im gonna uh, play the field just a little more. |6| So, will I like any of these guys? 
 But I do know that its some time tomorrow. _B_ |3| Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes. 
 Okay, great.  Hotel |4| I think you'll find this room more to your liking. 
 I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy. |9| What are you talking about? 
 Aw, don't do that _B_ Phoebe's |4| Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me? 
 Come on, Rach. |5| I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!" 
 Okay, lets play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.  _B_ |3| Okay, youre on. 
 Excuse me.  How ya doin'? |5| Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom. 
 I could use the money; it could give me time to write. |1| Thats great! That would be great! Lets do that! 
 No Im serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you. |3| Awww.  But still no. 
 What? |4|  Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight youre gonna have a bachelor party. 
 I can't belive it. |1| Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing".  
 I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy. |2| Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.  
 Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back. |3| So? 
 I know, I hate being left out of things. |0| I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding. 
 Why would you say that? |2| Welcome to New York City! Or should I say "ghe deu flooff New York City"? 
 Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up. |2| Oh. _B_ 
 Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me? |2| If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so. 
 Thats a good idea, Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday. I would like to get her something serious. |3| Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum. 
 Yeah all right, so well hang out. |5| 430. 
 Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you? |4| You think?! God, I, ah, Im in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachels all like, I love you and, and lets work on this. And all I can think about is, What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say? when I tell her what I did. 
 Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails. |7| Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I dont think any of them are gonna work out. 
 Okay.   I wanna quit the gym. Gym |1| Good! Thats good! 
 Well, thanks. I grow it myself.  Yknow who also has great hair is Joey! |9| You have really great hair. 
 You do know that Wham broke up? |3| Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it. 
 Hey ladies! What are you in here for?  |9| I know!  Don't switch hands, okay? _B_ 
 Im sorry man, theres never a good time to  stop catching on fire. |1|  Oh, I cant believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow? And it wouldnt matter. Now I gotta be careful?! 
 You dont even have a car! |5| Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound. 
  Hi! Im back.  Yeah, that sounds great.  Okay. Well, well do it then.  Okay, bye-bye.  |5| When youre off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza? 
 Well, cause she came back the third summer and shed gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow |5| Why? 
 Okay.  |5| Okay. I can do that. 
 Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?! |1| Yeah? 
 Whos that? |5|  This one is uh Paul ONeil. 
 Okay!  Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought  Wait a minute, I-I can do this.  I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you,  you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.  And if youll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.  Monica, will you marry me? |2| Chandler In all my life I never thought I would be so lucky.  As to fall in love with my best my best Theres a reason why girls dont do this! 
 Look forget it okay? I dont want to go. I dont want to see him. I dont wanna. |4| No you didnt. Oh and honey, just so you know, now that youre marrying me, you dont get to win anymore. 
 Oh honey, leave them alone, theyre in love. |4| Theyre kissing lets just go around them. 
 So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you? |3| I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them! 
 Oh come on! |2| Oh okay. 
 All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony? |1| I swear, if you try it, you will love it! 
  What?! |3| Yknow! You dont make a very good first impression. 
 Yes, but havent you wanted a kid like forever? |2| Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now! 
 Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back? |1| Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.  
  Funniest guy she's ever met!  I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes...  Save it for inside!  |3| Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey. _B_ 
  Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! |0| Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees... 
 But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together. |6| I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back. 
 Okay, the old hug and roll. |6| Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you. 
 Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean. |1|  I gotta go water Pete's plants.  Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants. 
 Guys are signing over their 401-Ks to me? |4| Chandler! 
 Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do! |3|  They say he's only got half a tank left. 
 Ow! |2| That's not possible! 
  Hey! |8| And if you wait right here, Ill go get Ross.  _B_ 
 Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats! _B_ |9|  Oh yes of course, hello Chandler. 
 Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV? |5| So, do we have the best friends or what? 
  He took my joke, he took it. |4|  She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel. 
 Okay! |7| Oh right great! Welcome aboard! 
 We cant accept this. |8| See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left. 
 Oh no-no, I cant do that. |0| Really? Okay, so why dont you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland? 
 Joe |9| Well then let me do it! 
  Okay. Heres a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces. |2| Honey, we gotta go! 
 Wow! I dont have the worst costume anymore! |0| Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik?  Well, Im a potato or a spud. And these are my antennae.  So Sputnik, becomes  Spud-nik. Spudnik! 
 Honey! Thats crazy! I dont want you to get me a stripper |3| Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?! 
 They do me? |0| Yeah, yeah. They even do you. 
 On every word? |7| Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus! 
 You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up. |4| So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time. 
  Hi. Anybody know a good tailor? |1|  Hello? Hi. 
 Who said anything about Christmas? _B_ |2| Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas. 
 OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. _B_ Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . _B_ wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there. _B_ |0| Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me? 
 All right. Look, Im gonna go in here, and you dont buy me anything ever.  |1| Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious. 
 Yes. Vividly. |9| Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us? 
 I wanna quit the gym. Gym |1| You wanna quit? 
 What-what cha doin? |9| Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, Im basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.  
 All right, all right, Ill go sleep with my girlfriend. But Im just doing it for you guys. _B_ |5| Go on. 
 Raymond Chandler. |8| Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler. 
 What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular. _B_ |6| chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them.   So then, this is Bear Claw. Okay, umm, Turkey Leg and Old Lady.  
 Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we? |0| This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home. 
 Gary, I'm here to report a crime. |4| Hey Chandler, what are you doing here? 
 Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street. |6| All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. Im gonna go see my agent. 
 And? |2| I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it. 
 Whoa, snowing out there? Mr. |3| Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats! _B_ 
 Hi. |8| Hey listen, so whens-whens my audition? I mean I know its Thursday, but what time?  
 Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store weve been too and I cant find the perfect ring!  Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring!  Its a beautiful selection.  |1| My God, Im sorry! Im sorry! I didnt mean to do that! I wouldnt do that!  _B_ 
 I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow " |2| Fat?! 
 Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking! |8| There's no dog in here. _B_ 
  400 A.M. |5| Oh please!  Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven. 
 Thats me! Come on! |3| The wedding is off, sloppy and immature! 
 Pierce Brosnan? |9| He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background.  Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan! 
 No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, youd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Yknow its hard enough to be fourteen. Youre skinny. Youre wearing speedosThat your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and theres your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. He was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack! |6| Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know 
 She mustve been planning this for years! |8| Dont you see? Its the perfect crime! 
 Are you serious?! |4| Oh you dont know. 
 Hey! |8| Heeeeeey! 
 Hey!  |8| Santa!  
 She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she? |1| At the vet. 
 Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow. |4| Hey guys, how is it going? 
 Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play! |3| Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these  on my pillow. 
 Okay, one question. |4| Yep. 
 No, no, no, actually losers rhyme. _B_ |1| Yeah, losers talk! 
 Hes right. Nobodys gonna benefit, and youre just gonna hurt her. |1| Look, Ross look, Im on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff thats gonna get you in trouble. 
 Weve got to do something! |3| Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish! 
 It just doesnt feel like were breaking up. |1| Op, the ruined quiches are ready. _B_ 
  Yes.  Okay, theres this one guy, Patrick, I think youre gonna like him, hes really nice, hes funny, hes a swimmer. |2|  You work with robots!! 
 Where is Emily? |2| Oh-no, dont try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear. 
 What? Why? |1| We're switching rooms again. 
 Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough. |3| I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way. 
  Art lover! |9| Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this. 
  You did. |7|  Who got married?!  
  What gave me away? |6| Ugh, I thought you were Rachel! 
 You got it. Good woman!  Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne? |4| I will go for that drink. 
 You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? Im going to get a joke journal. Yknow? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes. |1| Its wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel. 
 All right!  |7| All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I dont need any assistance in there, take a break! 
 Our guy has great hair. |8| My guy is well read. 
 Cause its gross. |3| Why not? 
 Okay. |5| If you tell me, Ill tell you what Phoebe said. 
  So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?  |5|  How did he do this? 
 Yes, include more people in this. |7|  I dont have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does. 
  All right, this isnt so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because Ive got my boat. |1| Bet I know how that discussions going to go. _B_ 
 Y'don't think that makes me seem a little... |9| Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet. 
 Hey Joe! |9| This is easy...Can't do this!  Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this.  _B_ 
 I don't sound like that. |7| You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'  
 Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor? |6| Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here.  What if the baby needs him? 
 Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go! |2| Dude, two times that happened! 
 No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk. |2| Needs some clothes altered? 
 Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon. _B_ |5| All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon. 
 I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . . _B_ _B_ MR. |4| You know what the. . . _B_ 
 But... |0| Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too. 
 Why not?! |4|  No, no, you cant, you cant, okay, you cant, you cant buy her pearls, you just cant, you cant, you cant. 
  Twenty-three!! Seventy-four!!  You wanna go shotgun? |0| No, no, no, actually losers rhyme. _B_ 
 Yeah, I-I-I think so.  Yeah, I-I think so... |2| She was kidding about that right? 
  I wanna quit the gym. Gym |1| You do realize that you wont have access to our new full service Swedish spa. 
 Kay. |6| Checking to see if its even. 
 All right, I'm nine years old. |9| Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday? 
 Okay, there are no famous Joeys. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco. |1| Someone you didnt make up! 
 Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen. _B_ Mrs. |8| Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book. 
 Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head. |2| And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law. 
 If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference? |5| Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up. 
 It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together. |3| Yeah? 
 There you are. _B_ |7| And six others. 
  We didnt get to the audition. Im gonna take her to coffee and then well do it then. |4| Hey! 
  Take whatever you want, just please dont hurt me. |1| Sup? Sup dude? 
 Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad? |2| You broke up with a girl because she was fat?! 
 What is it doing here? |2| No that's just me coughing!  Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room. 
 I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work!   He does not know that I am not some of us. |1| So, can I get some candy? 
 Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill. |1| Okay.  But wait, we cant. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have lunch. 
 Are you serious? |2| Uh-huh. 
 He had sex with Mr. Garibaldi! |0| Hey, the point is that he was at every one of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? Thats a, thats a pretty great dad. 
 Honey, isnt it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair? |6| I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain! 
 Look, I appreciate it, but uh, its a little creepy. Yknow? Im not a bachelor anymore. |3| Come on! Come on, itll be fun! Itll make me feel so much better. 
 What is it that I do? |2| Yes, when I first met you, you were like, "Blah, blah, blah." I was like, shhh! 
 So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state.  And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch. |0| Hey! 
 Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man? |6| What are you doing here, Santa? 
 What happened? |0| Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it. 
 Great!  This baby'd better be really good. _B_ |8| Oh yeah, let's do that! 
 Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me! |4| What are you talking about? These aren't mine. 
 Hey, how's the first day goin'? |8| Hey. 
 You're pretending the pillow's a girl right? _B_ |3| Shoot. 
 Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that. |9| Tah-daaah! 
 Okay.  Yes.  Uh, cant you wait until tomorrow?  All right.  Unbelievable!! |4| No, we are. Im sad. 
 Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards. |4| Ohh, I like swimmers bodies! 
 Man, didnt she like just get here? |3| Ugh, shes saying good-bye to her uncle. 
 No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud! |0| I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her. 
 I said art lover. |7| What'd you say? 
 Okay, so thats it, everybody knows! Its official, were moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya? |7| I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and shes the only one left! 
 That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy.  I've always wanted to know... _B_ |0| Each. 
 Yeah! |8| Thats a good idea. 
 Our guy smells incredible. |2| My guy has great teeth! 
 Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?  "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation." |2| My God! What happened to you? 
 So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, were on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy. |8| Okay. 
 Well, thank you for lunch. |9|  Well see. _B_ 
 Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night. |6| Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow well be getting married? 
 Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less. |4| ...Yeah. 
 Oh my God. |4|  So? 
 Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.  |7| ...desperate, needy, pathetic? 
 Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it. |5| Hey! 
 And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...? |8| Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’. 
 No reason.  _B_ |1| Yeah, why? 
 Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance! |6| Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15.  All right, when was 1990? 
 What is the thing? |4| Oh God. Uh, okay, heres the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is... 
  Hike! Monica and |9| Yeah! 
 Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities? |8| Wait a minute, one box! Come on, Im trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, Im putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you? 
 Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do? |3| God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh? 
 All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timings right. And thats what deathbeds are for. |5| Yeah, but dont you think.... 
 Thanks. |9| Okay.  Yes.  Uh, cant you wait until tomorrow?  All right.  Unbelievable!! 
  Oh the phone! The phones making sounds!  Hello! |7| Looks good.  
 I walk into a room and he wont even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words. |0| Oh my God, is it really that bad? 
 We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced. |9| Oh, I hate this story. 
 Wh-wh-why?! |0| Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head. 
 I gotta check out this hot girl!  There she is!  _B_ |8| No, in Ross's building!  She's back! She's back!  Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second.  Got it!  
 Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me. |4|  What's up? 
 Yknow when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you dont, you dont do that every year do you? |5| We are so gonna find them this year. 
 Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please. |8| Can I help you? 
 Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19. |5| So youre playing a little Playstation, huh? Thats whack! Playstation is whack! Sup with the whack Playstation, sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?! 
 Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget.  Seriously, good luck marrying me. _B_ |3| Well, apparently she does. 
 Hey, where you been? |8| Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate...  How long has that been there?  
 007?! This is James Bonds tux?! |6| Yeah. 
 Does it matter?! |3| Whos Mr. Garibaldi? 
 So, shouldnt we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go snooping around her crotch? |8| I guess. 
 What are you doing?! |8| Oh, Id like a latte. Oh yknow what? If youre gonna talk about me, Im gonna go with you.  
  Did you like me when we first met? |6| Well its just like youre trying too hard. Always making jokes, yknow, you justYou come off a little needy. 
 I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking. |1| How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that adwith a little kid walks to grandpa, it's chilling. 
  And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk. |3|  Was your cabin pressurised? 
 What? |4| I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember? 
 So what does this mean? |2| She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent. 
 Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me? |0| You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it! _B_ 
 So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?  |0| We went through the same thing when we were adopting. 
 Okay.  And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries! |8| Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four. 
 Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom? |4| That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before. 
 Where are they? Where are they? |1| ...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now. _B_ 
 Well there you go. |7| Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column. 
 Well, then, I might as well offer to stay. _B_ |3| Pity food? Y'know what thats okay, all right, I dont need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays. 
  There he is! |9| No, Im good.  _B_ 
 See, Im not bad at this fixing up thing, huh? |1| Op, I like credit cards! 
 Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, hell never be President. Theres never gonna be a President Joey. |0| Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if its like yknow, Chanoey? 
 Easy tiger. |9| Yeah!! Yeah! 
 Uh-huh.  |2|  Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second? 
 Well it's not flexed right now! _B_ |4| This bicep? 
 I don't know, I'm very tired. |0| Is that supposed to be an insult? 
 Wow that was my scariest voice! Youre very brave.  |5| No. 
 Picking Rachel. |7| Do you know whats a bad idea? 
 Honey, it is not a date! I havent talked to her in ten years! You cant just call up somebody you havent talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, yknow? You gotta, you got to put in some time. |1| Wow! So, now youre going on a date with this girl? 
 Hey. |8|  Do you want our guy to be your guy? _B_ 
 Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something. |1| That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that! 
 Okay, we owe you a present. |8| Yeah! I bet I can do it.  
 No, he visited a little town south of throw up.  So what was Phoebes secret? |2| Oh my God. He threw up? 
 Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up! |0| Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic! 
 So apparently we just dont pay for food anymore.  Do you see what I see? |0| What? Wait a minute, I didnt pay, I thought you paid! 
  Yknow, we havent found anybody else. |1| Yeah and the most important thing is that it wont be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. Itll be me! And I swear Ill do a really good job. Plus, yknow I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me. 
  Hi! Nice to meet you! |9| I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler. 
 Well you dont have to sound so surprised. |8| I just, I cant believe that we made it! 
 We are on our honeymoon. |8|  Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Lets act like were on our honeymoon. 
 Im going to need a bigger boat. _B_ |4| I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial! 
 Whats wrong with you? |6| Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose! _B_ _B_ 
 She answered. |5| How many beeps? 
 And that would have made the official party line.  Monica and I are having a little financial trouble. |6| I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica. 
 I mean, you have a lovely home. |7| So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?  
 Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon.  I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade? |4| What are these, like famous chickens? 
  What? |4| Okay. I went down to the Mattress King showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband. 
 Oh, hey. |7| Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert. 
 She was kidding. |2| Dude, I dont know. 
 Okay.  |5| No, no, that was my boss. I have to go. 
  I wanna quit the gym. |1| Sorry, members only. 
 Hey its Joey! |8|  Hey dude, its me. 
 Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse. _B_ |9| Oh my god. 
 Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?! |0| Well, because she loves you and because you love her. 
 How do you figure that? |4| Hey, I'm more cop than you two! 
 Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together! |4| Sure. Okay. 
 You dont, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything? Phoebe and |5| Yeah. 
 No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice. |2| Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened? 
 Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear! |4| Come on man, really how old?! 
 Score. |8| I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries. 
 How do you know so much about this? |4| It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money! 
 Oh, I have to get married in James Bonds tux! |6| Yeah. 
 Yeah o-okay, but Im just doing this for you. |6| Chandler, youre not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe its time that you let that stuff go. If your fathers not at your wedding youre gonna regret it for the rest of your life. 
 Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient? |5| Fine. Im just glad I didnt give her my secret ingredient. 
 All right fine! But Im only doing this for you! |7| Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked! 
 I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife! |2| Nothing! I swear to God I didnt know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didnt believe in soul mates. So 
 Will power? I've watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs without taking the tin foil off. |7| So what? Don't you have any will power? 
 What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken?  See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right? |2| Okay.  
 Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.  |5| No, I think we killed it. _B_ 
 Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya? |0| uhu uhu, check this out.  
  M-Me, me, me! |7|  I'll do it! 
 Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!  |2| Rachel used to live in that room. 
 It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies. |5| This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us. 
 Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie? |5| Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie. 
 Y'know what, hes right. Theres something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain. |0| Dont blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel. 
 Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division. |7| Well, so what does he do? 
 Wow, youre, youre right. I have a horrible, horrible name. |0| All right look man, I didnt want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! Its not even a name; its barely even a word. Okay? Its kinda like chandelier, but its not! All right? Its a stupid, stupid non-name! 
 So what are you going to do? |4| I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, its-its so great. But at the same time Im thinking, "Well, Im gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off." 
  Yeah. |6| Chandler! 
 Hey. |8| Hey! 
 Maybe its the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts. |6| Thats right.  Did you hear something? 
 No, we only went out once. |2| Youre right, Im sorry. Its not like youre yknow, going out with an ex-girlfriend. 
 Well, you dont look good Joe. |6| Huh. 
 But uh Ross, Ross is a great guy! I was roommates with him in college. Uh, funny story  Youre roommate in college died didnt he? |6| Oh, you dont have to do that every time. 
 Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you hold out that ring and ask me to marry you? Male |6| This ring is from the 1920s, its a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side. 
 Thats it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that? |2| Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebes old massage place is getting fired. 
  Really? |5| That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days 
 Mm! Night Gar!  _B_ |8|  Mm! Seems like I wouldve remembered you! 
 Mrs. Braverman must be out.  |7|  Its still there!  
 What? |4| Im sorry but nothing. 
 This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-youGo to the doctor! |4| Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. But um, I dont think its anything serious. 
 This is ridiculous, hes not gonna hold his breath  |0| No dude, you gotta hold your breath until youre ready to answer the question. 
 I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.  |0| Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about. 
 You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work! |2|  What are you doing? 
 I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already? |2| I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks! 
 No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!  |0| Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.  
 What? What do you mean you know? |3| Yeah, I know. 
 Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.  |3| 'My scones.'  
  Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey! |8|  Well, I hope you're happy! 
  Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey! |8|  Well, I hope you're happy! 
  OK, this one right here is from me. |4| Well, thank you, Melanie. 
 What did you just do? |3| Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.  
 Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number. |1|  Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine? 
 So whaddya got there Monica? |8| She told us. 
 What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.  |0| Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong? 
 Well she, she wouldnt do that, shes with, shes with me. |8| They were in his office. 
 Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7. |9|  I almost caught that one! 
 She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules. |5| Yeah. 
  Well hes probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles. |2| Why? Do you think hes still mad at us? 
 Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw. |4| So, so, whatd ya think? 
 Im getting dressed. |5| What are you doing? 
 What? |4| Listen uh, Im really sorry, it looks like Im gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasnt there! 
 Hey Joe. |8| Oh. 
 Im right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now theres no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means! |0| Its this way? Sorry.  _B_ 
 I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! Im right. I'm right. Am I right? |2| Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica. 
 Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay. |4| Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner! 
 You mean scared. |3| Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy. 
 Because thats where Joey gave me some stuff to store that Ive never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!  _B_ |6| No, we never do that  
 Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you. |5|  Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up. 
 Joe? |4| Wow thanks!  
 Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err...  |2| She is so hot! 
 Richard used to do it, didn't he? |1| I don't know. 
 Yeah you can do it. |9| So I can do it? 
 Oh, its not just that, I would be Englands most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majestys secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill.  Would Monica let me wear this? _B_ |9| Its a pretty cool tux. 
 So I really never get to win anymore? |0| Yes! 
 Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria? |4| Alright boys, let's eat. 
 And Joey. |9| Yeah! 
 'kay, |9| You said that was sexy! 
 Yeah, he came up... |4| No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right? 
 No, come on, you know that's not true. |6| Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead.  Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!? 
 That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!  _B_ |0| Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.  
 You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from here,  your full sized aortic pump. _B_ |2| Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself! 
 Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus. |9| You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one. 
 . Well played.  |8| Joey's bare ass! 
 Here we go. |6| Eww, I don't wanna do that.  
 Weird world. Your kids? |7| Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh? 
 All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to? |7| Yeah, its hard okay, I only have two spots left. 
 ....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?! |9| Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake. _B_ 
 Well, thats the best kiss Ive had with anyone Ive ever met in a mens room. |9| I ran!! _B_ 
 Its a big company, I dontif youI |3| Your company has a fine foods division? 
 Okay. |5| Im sorry man, I didntIm-Im sorry. Im sorry.  
 I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you. _B_ |9| Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers! 
 What are you doing? |8| Hey. 
 Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap.  Seriously. |9| Ugh, the worse day! Yknow, you think youre making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel. 
 You know Oh My God. |4| Whats up?  
 Not once! |3| You dated her! 
 Thats still in there?! |4| The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limesHey, what was in that brown jar? 
  Oh my God thats it, thats the ring! How much is it? |1| Okay.  Will you marry me? 
 Well, it still has to go, right? Monica and |7| Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog? 
 By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake. |0| She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months. 
 Honestly? Me too. |8| Well honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to.. to flip you out. 
 Hey! Did you find the cameras? |6| Chandler? 
 Let me see that. |1| Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris Holy cow, thats a big word. Trisc Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that? 
 Why? |4| Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave. 
 I don't do that.  |7| Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours. 
 Oh! Right. |7| Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad. 
 Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout. |2| I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars! 
 Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great! |8| Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives! 
 Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great! |8| Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives! 
 Hey. |8| Phoebs, he's just a little dog. _B_ Ahhh. _B_ 
 What? |4| Oh, my. 
 Yeah, well, youre wrong! Okay, youre wrong. |2| Im telling you man, I saw it. 
 Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....  |6| Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you dont want to be doing something and then look up and see something you dont want to be seeing. 
 Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issacs sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebes friends with Rachel. And thats the trail, I did it! _B_ |6| Oh, I-I dont think theres any trail. 
 I know. |5| I-I wasnt in that. 
 When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me. |0| Why? 
 Okay. |5| Yeah, it mustve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog. 
 Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there! |8| All right, lets not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them. 
 Why? |4| Hey, how do you spell suspicious? 
 Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game. |3| Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved! 
 Sure, I'll do it with ya. |5| Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me? 
 Okay. It's not different at all, is it? |3| No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different. 
 Scared? Happy? |5| No, I mean happy. 
 Ok, well, this was very special. |4| Hi, Monica. 
 Yes, we were just  |3|  Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth.  So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about. 
  Well.... it is amouz-ing...  |4| It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche. 
 Uh, youve had a lot of sex right? |5| Yeah! 
  Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick! |0| Chandler, you have an assistant right? 
 Aww!  |6| I know. Lets try a look of far off wonderment. Okay, well-well gaze into our future and well think about our marriage and the days to come.  Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!"  Hey! Dont laugh at him! Hes my drowning moron! 
 Mustached bastard |1| We'd be eating our soup right now. 
 Yeah. |6| All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right? 
 Ill be right with you. _B_ |6|  Chandler! 
 Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech?  "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!" |5| You still on that? 
 Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough. |6| Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite? 
  Were you there? |9| Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.  
 I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth? |4| I don't do that.  
 Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community. |7| What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead! 
 Hey! |8| Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously...  Did you think the neighborhood was homey?  
 Is it really that bad? |2| Help me! This hurts! 
 Is it really that bad? |2| Help me! This hurts! 
 Hey, Janice. |1| Ok, have a good break-up. 
 Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know. |5| Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler. 
 Well, we could count again. |3| Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here? 
 Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained. |3| I figure my character has kids. 
 Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom. |1| Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order. 
 Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving. |6| Okay, Elizabeth Hurely.... 
  So ah, isnt a bit cold out for shorts? |6| Oh. 
 Um, is it sugarless? |2| Would you like some gum? 
  Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle. |3| Actually, me too. 
 What? |4| Chandler!! 
 Well sensitive is important, pick him. |8| Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive. 
  Sure... |6| You know what we should all do? Go see a musical. 
 Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby? |0| I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby. 
 Are you serious? |2| I could ask her to live with me! 
  Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming! |0| Okay, this one I like! 
 You built a fort didn't ya? |7| Nothing. 
 Well, I-I still think youre very-very nice and very pretty |8| I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky! 
 Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, yknow Ive always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father. Mr. |8| Yknow dad, Chandler is one of Rosss very best friends! 
 Is this a service youre providing me? |2| Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me? 
 Okay, it's um |9| Why? 
 Well, we dont want that. |0| No that could kill her. 
 Yeah. Yknow I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and Ill go all Chandler. But nothing has. |1| Really? 
 Yes! And thats why Im under the table. Celebrating. |8| No. Did you? 
 I dont think the flash went off. |2| What a beautiful place. What a great night! I have to tell you, being here with all of you in Event Room C I feel so lucky. I think of all the good times that have happened here. The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but none of them will compare with tonight! My God, I dont want to forget this moment! Its like I want to take a mental picture of you all! Click!  
 Triscadecaphobia. |0| This one right here.  
 You forbid me? |5| That's right, because I forbid you to smoke again. 
 But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly. |0| Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it. 
 Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money. |1|  That's the fastest I have ever thought! 
 And there's not chance that will work? |3| No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike! 
 And there's not chance that will work? |3| No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike! 
 Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that? |3| You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do? 
 Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets? |5| What? 
 Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband. |4| She wants to meet you in person. 
 'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.  |1| So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight? 
 Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it. |3| Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we...  y'know each would,  y'know  be? 
 What is it? |4| Wait. I wanna show you something. 
 Oh yeah man.  Joey.  |7| Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize. 
  Okay. Mrs. |0| Hi, I'm Ross's little sister. 
 Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0. |9| Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.  
 Let them win one. |5| I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said. 
 Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.  |7| Thanks! 
 I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there! |7| Chandler, what-what are you doing? 
 Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this ones free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third ones free. |1| Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?  
  Really. |4| I whitened them. 
  Oh thats great, my friend Joeys in the movie business. |7| Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.  _B_ 
 Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted to, but I couldnt . There huhhmm, there-there was an incident. |0| When? Today? Some, not a lot. 
 What about him? |3| No, I-I just dont know how you decide who to hire. I mean Ive got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then theres this guy 
  Excuse me... _B_ Male |1|  Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table! 
 I |5| Uh actually, sorry I cant even make it. Im seeing Mona again tonight. 
 I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen. |8| How do you get a monkey into a zoo? 
 Today is the sixth. |7| Yeah. 
 Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief. |0| I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!  
 Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here? |1|  You son of a bitch! 
 Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me! |5|  Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman. 
 Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please? |8| Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day. 
 Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes. |6| Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does. 
 Eh, y'know what, shes to political, she probably wouldnt let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first. |2| Susan Sarandon. 
  Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing? |5| Hey!! Hey-hey-hey! 
 Oh no, no, no, no. |0| Yeah, I can dance, y'know.  
 Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.  |4| Well, Im from California. 
 Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental |1|  Sorry, it's not. 
 Yeah, were gonna have to get you out of those shoes. |8| Oh damn, I hate that. 
 Beam me up Jesus. |6| What does the sign say? 
 I don't know... um, Grease? |0| And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one? 
 Because youve only known her for six weeks! Okay, Ive got a carton of milk in my fridge Ive had a longer relationship with! |2| I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?! 
 Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun? |0| Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this? 
  Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was  |9|  Kinda. 
  All yours babe.  |8| What? 
  Hes the headliner of a gay burlesque show. _B_ |6| I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do? _B_ 
 Janice is gonna go away now. |2| Oh my god. Janice, hi! 
 Our new fridge? I dont live here anymore. |5| No! No! No! For my new fridgeour new fridge! 
 Oh yeah, I should probably call them. Mr. |2| So Chandler, your parents mustve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged. 
 But we should take it. |8| No, so were protecting her. 
 Okay. Ill be right there.  |5| Ohh, Im so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean its really, its made me stay calm.  I coulda been worse! 
 Well this is great. Yknow, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, shes really depressed. |6| Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-ones turned them. 
 25J and K, any chance those arent together? _B_ |6| You see, if wed gone around them like I said, weShe wouldve given us those tickets. Damnit! 
 You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is shehere by the way? |8| Mhmm. 
 Fine, I'll give the suit back.  |0| I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me. 
 Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!  |8| Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars? 
  Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler! |5| No, I called him. It's not gonna happen. 
  Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler! |5| No, I called him. It's not gonna happen. 
 That's great.  Can I see the book?  |3| I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us. 
 Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.  |1| There is a little child inside this man! 
 What did you just do? |3| What is the big deal?  
 Okay, I'll do it! |6| What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip. 
 Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out. |5|  I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman. 
 Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer.  See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser. |2| Ohhh, are you a puppy!  Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper. 
  Im up! Im up, Ive gotten up now! Anybody ah, want anything? |6| Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames.  
 Well it you dont know that, then I dont want to do this with you. _B_ |4| Yeah, I guess, but whats like heads and whats tails? 
 So thats the girl you like. |7|  Excuse me. Excuse me.  Sweetheart!  Come!  
 Ah-ha, youre not the boss of me.  Yeah, you are!  Ooh, saucy. |5| Just a little gag gift somebody gave me.  Put your hands together. 
 Yeah. Yes! Yeah.  |8|  Hey.  Oh no its fine, dont worry about it.  Yeah-no, stop apologizing, its okay.  Yeah! Ill talk to you tomorrow.   I should uh, probably go. 
 Yknow uh, you didnt really have to help me pack. |1|  Janice. 
 I happen to know a Fun Bob. |7| You know more than one Fun Bobby? 
 Okay, I'll stop. |3| You're driving me crazy with that! 
 You're not even giving them a chance! |3| Are you crazy?! We own those two! I mean look at 'um, he can't breath and she's popping pills. 
 Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors. |7| Sorry! Sorry! Oh,  there!  Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!  _B_ 
 Were you're parents happy, or something? |3| I know! I can't wait! 
 Hey. |8| And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler.  
  My friends name is Joey. |7| Yknow who I ran into from school? Howie. 
 Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby. |7| Oh! Ross is sooo great! _B_ 
 Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000. Male |8|  Are you interested in this ring?! 
 Its happened to you? |4| Dont worry about that man, that happens. 
 Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me? |0| They cant all be bad.  Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is. 
  I have to! Okay? It's time!  Okay, I hate dogs. |1| Don't do what? 
  Ahh-hahaha!  _B_ |6|  Good evening.  
 Fear of Triscuts? |6| No! No, fear of the number 13. 
 Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.  |1| Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility. 
 Yes, it's also 2003. |4| No, it's not.  
 Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come. |0| You're right. There isn't a decent outlet. 
 Me too. |9| You know what? You can have mine. 
 You want me to wash my hands first, don't you? |3| That's great.  Can I see the book?  
 Oh, because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law. |7| Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We’re really excited about getting this process started. 
 You are going downer! |1| Please, you're going down! 
 I'm okay. |4| Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!  
 I'm okay. |4| Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!  
 Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her. _B_ |0| I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it.  I gotta get out of here.  
 What? |4| We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...  
 Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs. |7| Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine. 
 Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there. _B_ |7| Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did. 
 Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know shes too international, y'know shes never gonna be around. |4| And!! Isabella Rosselini. 
 Hi Joeys sisters! |8| How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joeys sisters. 
 No, really youre gonna freeze. |1| Oh, dont worry about it. 
 Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom. |2| No, the No Smoking sign. Theres no smoking in my Grandmothers cab. 
 Big bullies!!  |0| Oh, come on! 
 Rent? |3| No.... 
 And I love the milk! But, Im not gonna some British girl to move in with me!  Joey, you say things now. |9| Look guys, when Im with her its-its-its like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, yknow? 
 Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms? |0| Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight! 
 I hate this thing! |0| Dude, you should've gone out once and a while. 
  Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants?  Someone comment on the pants! |0| Auntie Monica!!  
 Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested. |1| I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds. 
 Hey. |8|  2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?  _B_ 
 Uh-huh. |2| So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple. 
 Oh, I dont think I ever heard that story. |6| I remember when we first got engaged. 
 Why? |4| But we should move quick. 
 I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. Its called being a good conversationalist. Watch.  Say something. |2| What?! Chandler, shes our cousin! 
 All my energy is going into not asking that question. I cant believe I screwed this up! |2| Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed? 
 Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man. |5| Come on! 
 Thats still in there?! |4| The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limesHey, what was in that brown jar? 
 Hello sir, you know Monica. _B_ |9| Well I’m peeking.  Oh my God! 
 Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be? |0| Don't joke  with me, okay? I'm very, very upset right now. 
 Santa? Really? |5|  Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?  
 Oh ok. |6| Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is.  
 This vacation sucks!! _B_ |0| Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place! 
 This vacation sucks!! _B_ |0| Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place! 
 Oh, that's Ross's. |5| Who's this from? 
 Wow, he looks so normal. |5| Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook. 
 Look, are you gonna be ok? |3| That's who. 
 Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get. |5| Oh, you didn't have to do this. 
 All right, I have to get that, but no-no.  Hello?   Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that.  Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred?  So would I, would I have to provide the grapes? |1| Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.  
 Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?  _B_ |2|  Morning. We ready to go? 
 Me too!! |7| Nothing. Im gonna take a shower. 
 Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this. |7| Pretty nice? 
 You are, youre gonna leave me like this? |4|  Ill be back in ten minutes.  
 Oh.  |5| I forgot my purse. 
 Fears and Pet Peeves. |7| Its heads.  Gentlemen, pick your category. 
 Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not! |1| Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didnt really leave me much choice. Did you? 
 Hey Phoebe! |9| Or an uncle...  Joey and 
 Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary. |2| Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I justI wanna be around her as much as I can. 
 So it's pretty much the same Pheebs. |9| So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London? 
 Yeah, Ive always hated that Howie. |5| Apparently Howies editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Yknow I-I-I havent spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor! 
 No, the little girl creeps me out. |4| No, you said the baby creeps you out. 
 Well, whatd you do? |5| Yeah! Once. 
 Were the Bings.  |9| Hey Maureen!  Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen. 
 Thank you. Mrs. |9| Congratulations. 
 What? |4| Hey. We found her, we found the girl. 
 It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay. |3| Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant. 
 Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!? |9| Exactly!!  
  I wouldn't know, I didn't make it!  _B_ |1| Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team? 
 Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle. |4| Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life! 
 Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle. |4| Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life! 
  What... did you get me there? |7| What? 
 So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whos gonna be in the country like all the time. |5| So? 
 Youre not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot? |3| No, Im not. 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute, you dont like the guy Rachels dating? Well, thats odd. _B_ |3|  Im telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think hes baaad news! 
 Okay, so when do you want to go? |2| Yes! Rent! 
 Hey! Im sorry! That where are you going? |5| Ready?  _B_ 
 Do not speak ill of the dead. |1| I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas! 
 Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.  Fat |8| Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner. 
 You wanna play? |3| Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now. 
 Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro?   Please let them win! |4| Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game. 
 Yeah, what was wrong with your old human teeth. |1| Ross theyre really, really, really white. 
 Oh, good, Joey's home now. |1|  Whoa. 
 What?! |3|  Chandler. I sensed it was you. 
  Okay |5| And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid. 
 Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!  _B_ |8| Because I think I just heard her moving around in there. 
 Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away? |8| Im sorry man.  Heres a thought. This is the same ballroom. Theres a band. Theres gonna be plenty of dressed up people. 
  Whats wrong? |0|  Ahhhhhhhh! 
 Then, I might as well ...  do this . Not really sure what to do now. |1| Yes. 
 Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa? |6| Yeah, is that okay? 
 Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.  |4| Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.  ENDING CREDITS _B_  
 Yeah  I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor. |5|  Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big. 
 That's what we were gonna name the baby. |3| Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock. 
 Yeah, didn't he tell ya? |3| Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game. 
 Well, actually just one birthday flan. |7| Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes. 
 Hey! |8| Rach, look!  Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.  There he is. _B_ _B_ 
 Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip. |1| Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer. 
 No, no, no, no, no!  |0| One-Mississippi, two-Mississippi, switch! Switch! Switch!! 
 Okay Ross, why dont you come with me? |5| Yeah, make that three. 
  Hi. |8| All right. 
 Hey! |8|  Oh, hey! 
 Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe. |3| We dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? Weve got a canoe.  
 Okay. But if you dont come back soon,  theres pretty much nothing I can do about it! _B_ |0| Knowing youre here, waiting for me I think its kinda exciting. 
 No-no-no-no, this is bad! Its bad! This is bad! |0| No, I really did forget my purse.  Commercial Break _B_ 
 Oh yeah! With who? |9| Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight. 
 Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly youre having sex with him. |7| Its a good play, isnt it?  
 Oh, Im packing. Yknow Im-Im packing cause Im moving to Yemen tomorrow. |2| Hey-hey, whats going on? 
 What is going on here? |2| Joey, is what she just said ummOh my God.  You were actually gonna   
 Hmm. |6| Isn't this great? 
 Here you go.  Now stop bringing us pizzas you. |9| Y'know, all I'm looking for is the money. 
 Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica! |6| So you know what I'm talking about, right? 
 Yeah, I guess it's a little better now. |1| Okay, what about after I give you these candies?  
 Hi. |8| No. No, I wont. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnt love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And thats how she ended up living with me!   Okay, thats a lie. _B_ 
 OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man.  Joe?  Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.  |2| We'll see. _B_ 
 The nerve huh? |0| No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first! 
 Why would the baby creep me out? |1| You said the baby. 
 Uh, credit card.  Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey.  Okay, Ill go get it. You guard the ring. |1|  How would you like to pay? 
 Let me see this guy.  W-H-Wow! Dont show this to Monica! And dont tell her about the W-H-Wow! _B_ |6| Okay youre right. Ill hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda! 
  What? What? What? |1| Okay, heres your milk. What do you want to talk about?  
 Mr. and Mrs. Bing!  |7| Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful! 
 Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so. Dennis |9| Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover. 
 Stick to your side! |5| Oh! Yay! Look! Theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it! 
 This game makes no sense! |1| Wait a minute, I-I believe Im entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn? 
 Tough crib. |8| Okay.  
 I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems? |0| Err... Kind of. 
 Ross, don't press send, don't press se... ! |3| No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me! 
 Funniest? Heckles? |2| "Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school." 
 Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet. |9| I got you...these.  
 How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago? |2| Well, yeah! Im still pursuing that. 
 Oh, come on, theres a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo. |2| No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas. 
 And youre our age. Youre our age. |9| So, youre like a zillionaire?  
 Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back? |8| My folks. 
 I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom. |9| We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you? 
 Okay, what is in here? Rocks? |7|  I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.  
 Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home. |1| Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule. 
 Oopsey, missed it! |9| I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.  
 Hi, Joe. |8|  Hey!  Oh. 
 Oh look, it's the woman we ordered. |1| Night, you guys.  
 Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel? |2| Unagi. Im always aware. 
 What a sweet story. |9|  You dont know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy! 
 Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic! |8| Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried! 
 Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding? |3| She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn. 
 I've had a very long, hard day. |6| Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!  
 Are you serious? |2| No-no-no, Im saying we-we buy more of this  at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody elses faces. 
 Oh dont forget, my office holiday party is tonight.  |6| Oh nothing Im justjust was yawning.  
 Then it's okaaay!  _B_ |9| No. 
 Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice. |8| Nope. We took her to lunch. 
 Hey, you must be Owen. |7| Can I adopt you?  
 I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in. |2| Go away! I don't want to see anybody. 
 But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building. |7| Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs.  
 Wow! |8| It's a... It's a boy! 
 Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?  |5| It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered! 
 Wow! |8| It's a... It's a boy! 
 You hear that? We're the guys. |5| Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys. 
 Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to. BIG |5| This couch belongs to us. 
 It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee. _B_ |8| What? 
 Of! |7| Wheel! 
 Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents! |7| We should? 
 Roberts coming out. |6| Okay.   What ah, what is the matter with you? Whats going on? 
 Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick? |3| Hey. 
 Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger. |9| What? 
 All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away! |0| You gotta take the canoe! 
 Yes, it is, at Office Max. |4|  Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls. 
 Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation? |5| Horrible! 
 Yeah. |6| You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie? 
 Im only going to pretend Im moving to Yemen, its the only way I can get rid off her. |2| Thanks for telling me!  
 Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go. _B_ |3| Yeah, no, youre right, I know, youre right, Im not, Im not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.  
 That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight.  Maybe there's something in that area.  |3| I like them a lot. 
 Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.  |5| Couldn't you just stay like this forever?  Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever? 
 You're welcome. |9| I'm gonna try.  
  Yeah, you're right about that. _B_ |5| No, it's too soon for you guys. 
  Happy plane-aversary. |8| Ah-ha! Okay,  Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back.  
 Rach |7| And Chandler, youre gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel cant be late. 
 Hi, listen, Im sorry about before. I dont need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldnt get girls, and now I can emNow, I have you.  Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women |3| Hi. 
  Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack. |1|  I Gotcha!! 
 Refill? _B_ |0| Yeah! 
 You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76.  Amouz-bouche?  _B_ |3| Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics. 
 They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit. |0| Told ya.  
 Hey Bob. |8| Okay, you go do it! Ill come back to that set! Ill meet more actors! Ill meet em all! _B_ 
 Oh come on Ross, I think were all losers here. |2| Yknow what? Youre just upset because youre losing. 
 Fine. What!? |3| We are already latefor Phoebe's birthday dinner, so you point out put out thatcigarette, we're gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex. 
 You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your familys. It's bad enough that we're working new year's eve.  Did I not tell *anyone* about new year's eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.  |8| Then it's okaaay!  _B_ 
 I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times. |4| Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here. 
 What? |4| Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her. 
 So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you? |5|  Why do men keep talking to me like this? _B_ 
 Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I.  He was right. Would you listen to that? |8| That's what it says. 
 I will have the uh, Cajun catfish. |9| Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care. 
 No, no, no, no, no, no  No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday. |1|  Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.  Commercial Break _B_ 
 I can't believe it. |1| Anything larger back there? _B_ 
 That's great.  |8| Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want. 
 Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party. |7| It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee. _B_ 
 Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.  |3| Aww.  Ohh! 
 Oh, Im taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer. Joeys |2| Wow. Okay, I dont know how to talk to you.  Sister 1  What cha doing? 
 Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier. |3| Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me. 
 Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves. |4| Oh, now I have to go!! _B_ 
 Okay, but this is the last time.  With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen. |3| No Im serious. I mean Im intuitive, but my memory sucks. _B_ 
 Bored and bored! |0| Oh, so, how are we doing? 
 What?! |3| I dont know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment. 
 Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two! |0| Clearly, Im having sex with him? 
 Does for me.  |5| And lucky means, more cleavage? 
 I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn." _B_ |7| What did you say? 
 So, rocks.  |8| No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples. 
 I'm intrigued. |7|  All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch? 
  Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!  |9| Yeah, two hours, a lifetime thats the same. 
 I cant figure out what to make Monica. |3| Whats up? 
 Oh come on guys, its not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it werent for  Monicas allergies.  Youre right, I could never lie to you. She hates you.  Should I get that?  Hello?  Uh no, Joeys not here right now. Can I take a message?  Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 500 to 230?  Okay great.  Bye.  |0| I want this part so much! Yknow? If I dont get this part Im never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!No, I didnt say that! Thats a lie. _B_ 
 This is going in your book? |5|  You guys, Im sorry, could you please talk a little slower? 
 Thank you Gunther, put it there.  Definitely not easier with coins.  Thank you. |9| Here you go. 
 Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then. |2| Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some? 
 Marriage advice? Really?! |3| Im just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down? 
 Now sweetie, I know you dont like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a supple leather lining. |9| Honey, we dont really have to go to this thing tonight do we? 
 I wasnt trying to open your closet! I wasnt trying to open your closet! I swear!  |5| Oh God Phoebe!!  Oh thats it! Thats it! Right there! Oh!  Ooooh-oooh-ooooh  _B_ 
 Good, God's speed, good people!  You're not gonna go? |7| You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your familys. It's bad enough that we're working new year's eve.  Did I not tell *anyone* about new year's eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.  
 I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too. |7| Yeah. 
 What? |4| Oh... 
 Very informative! |9| Excellent! 
 Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte? |3| That's great.  
 You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say? |8| Fortune! This guy is so stupid.  It's Count Rushmore!! 
 I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay. |3|  I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay? 
 No. He.....hes coming out of his shorts. |7| What, what do you mean, what? Is he gay? 
 You're watching a football game at a funeral? |4| Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.  
 A pen. |6| What did you get her?  
 Okay! |7| No-no-no, the kiss was good. 
 Oh come on!!  |2| Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow,  I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."  
 That new mountain bike? |7| No. 
 Yeah, I'm cool. Casual. |9| Are you okay? 
 What? |4| You couldn't let me have her, could ya?! 
 Can I give you a present now? |6| Aww! I love you! 
 I dont know. But I-I-I know I love you! |8| So, what do you think we should do? 
 Really? |5| Stop it Chandler.  Im sorry too. 
 Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000. |0|  Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! Thats like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo!  $500 that is a loooot of electricity!  Whoo-ho-ho!  I gotta buy some food. 
 Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monicas gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me? |2| Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great! 
 If I see him, Ill ask. |1| Hey! Hows my pal Toby doing today? 
 You are not going to believe what I did today! |6| Hey. 
 Let me think. Let me thinkOh! I dont care. |5| All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card. 
 If it helps, I could slide over. |1| Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?  
 You serious?  |1| Sex! This is the last day I'm ovulating, and when we don't doit now, we'll have to wait till next month.  
 I am not working. There's not much to do around here! _B_ |0| Chandler! 
 What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?  |1| Something personal. 
 No, I just had to get a picture of this.  |5| Dude, you're not tanned. 
 Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?  |5| I can't believe he did this. 
 What stupid thing did you do? |0| Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night. 
 Whoa! |7| I'd call that excessive. 
 Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you? _B_ |8| Anything else? 
 Because it's Sunday. It's God's day. |3| Why not? 
 Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay. _B_ |2| Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay. 
 Volleyball. |5| Quick volleyball question. 
 Hes right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want. |3| The fear? 
 No-no-no-no, no, its a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why cant we savor the precious moments?  Those are some huge breasts you have.  |3| Oh!! 
 Y'know what, pretty good. |9| Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya? 
 Hey. |8| Hey. 
  I-kea! This is comfortable. |9| No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything. 
 Oh my God! If you say that one more time, Im gonna break up with you! |4| She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her!   WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!! 
 Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that Ill stop seeing her? |1| Yeah, yknow at first I thought we could talk about this yknow, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I dont think I 
 Yknow, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know youre up there every night, youre naked, touching, kissing. |5| Okay, so let me just get this straight. Youre accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance? 
 Yeah. |6| We're so sorry. 
 Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back. |1| All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid. 
 Long!  _B_ |6| I got it!!  
 He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe! |6| Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someones eye out! 
 No, no no no. Youll be fine.  Hillarys bind, right? |2| I know. Thats why I did it.  Come on, are they really that bad? 
 Im going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade? |2| Oh, why dont you make her one of your little jokes. 
  Am I naked again?! |2|  Ahh! Arent you dressed yet? 
  Is there a puppy here? |3| Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies? 
 Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken. |0| Okay.  
 Hi. Mrs. |8| Ross, please! My make-up!   
 I dont know, Monica picked out the flowers. |7| Im telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Arent these the same flowers? 
 No. |4| Look at that! Look at that! Theyre going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there? 
 Why not? |4| I-I dont-I dont think that Im gonna wear the boots tonight. 
 Monica has a secret closet and she wont let me see whats in it. |9| Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing? 
 Well, youre forgetting about the time difference. _B_ |5| Wow, that didnt take long. I thought you said Tulsa was a three-hour flight? 
 Ah. Thanks. |3| Naah... I couldn't leave you alone. 
 ...Take off their hats! |7| Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader. 
 Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother. |5| You were? 
 I see you later!  end Crazy For Friends is best viewed at 800x600 with Internet Explorer 6.0. Contact Nikki here. © 2004 |8| No, I just had to get a picture of this.  
 Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor! |3| Amen. 
  It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see. |8| Oh, you did it! 
  It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see. |8| Oh, you did it! 
 That's it? |4|  No, no, I'm still working on mine.  
 No, Janice. |5| I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to? 
 It doesn't scare me! |3| You probably want us to move in together? 
 The man is showing brain. |2| What?! 
 Thats not a state Joe. |5| Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago. 
 You are a frightening, frightening man.  |8| No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception. 
 Huh-huh! You can't give her that. |3| It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh? 
 Ooh! Yes! Okay! Heres what we do, we-we forget it happened. |9| No, but thats bad! 
 No thank you. |7| Or Ill give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua. 
 I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually. |7| What-what are you doing? 
 Okay!  Oh man! Dont tell me I did this! |3| Okay! 
 So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you. |4| I know I love you!  
 Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know? Commercial Break _B_ |3| Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures!  I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip? 
 Ohh. |6| Yeah! Oh yes! 
 Oh yes! |9| You serious? 
 Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing? |1|  I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer. 
 Oh totally!  Pull my finger. _B_ |6| See? Thats what I mean. I mean that, thats great! But I wouldnt trade in what I have for that. I mean Im gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and thats what makes me happy.  Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is, dont you think? 
 I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler.  Although I-I hope they dont. |7| Well it clearly wasnt showering or shaving. 
 Either, it makes no difference. |2| You-you must choose Mr. Bing. 
 Right, fine, I'll do it, but no talking. |1| Oh yeah! 
 Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you? |3| All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it... 
 Hey, how'd the interview go? |5| Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.  
  ahem... um... Crystal duck. |5| What did you just say? 
 Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modelers club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool. |7| What? 
 Okay. |5|  Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks. 
 What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans? |1|  Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh. 
 Okay, stop. |3| Okay, if you say stop, then we stop. 
 Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you. GIRL'S |0| Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you? 
 Because, Im too afraid. |2| Well then how come youre still at a job that you hate, I mean why dont you quit and get the fear?  
 To yourself.  Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good. |9|  The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty... 
 Good! I havent smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse. |4| Yeah? 
 She? |5| Hows she doing? 
 Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up! |2| Look, its not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I dont want to live with some one who doesnt know what it is to be a friend. So, Ill see ya.  
 His legs flail about as if independent of his body! |3|  The Irish gig guy?! 
 Well, you can understand, given how we started. |7| Acting! Chandler, this is my job! Im-Im playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?! 
  Okay.  Joey, trade lives with me! |7| Okay, Chandler, come on! 
 No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your  adult film class. |4| Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig! 
 Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle? |4| Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts. 
 Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.  |8| I can't believe you let them win! 
 Fine.  |6| Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on. 
 Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day! |4| Nothing! 
 Theyre not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass! |1| No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, thats just gonna mess them up. 
 Yeah.  |6| She will be after tonight. 
 Well its kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that hes not real. |8|  You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray? 
 Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon. |4| Yknow what? Shed-shed love this.  Uh, its an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade. 
 Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit? |1| Were supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes. 
  Okay, you are new! |6| You don't like puppies? 
 Hey Pheebs! |9| Here.  Now I only owe you $49.50. 
 Hey Joe!  |9| Chicken? I could eat some chicken. 
 Mom. Thanks for wearing something.   Mrs. |8| Chandler! 
 She picked those out too. |9| What about the chairs? 
 Just act like you belong. |4| Me neither! We have to get in!  
 Yeah! Mr. |9| Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too? 
 Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company? |2| Well yknow, Im just-Im just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise! 
 I dont know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I cant see?! |3| Why not? 
 Thats right. Your husbands home, so now the sex can stop. _B_ |3| Huh, Chandler  youre home! 
 Ah.  Chandler Bing. _B_ |9| Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham. 
 You know how to use a compass? |6| Huh? 
 Well, that's spongy. |0| Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?  
 Well, that's spongy. |0| Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?  
 What am I gonna do, huh? _B_ |1| Hey now you have two. _B_ Oh, now you have two. 
 Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal. |2| Yeah, it was really hard. 
 You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice? |5| Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers. 
 Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood... |6| Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder. 
 Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!!  Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.  Commercial Break _B_ |4| Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um... 
  Hey Joey, do you wanna play football or you wanna..  Hi, Im Chandler. |9| Im sorry Dutch, I didnt get that last little bit. 
 Look, Ross, you have what you want, youre back with Rachel. If you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you. |2| No? 
 Hi!  How are you?  s office. |9| Yeah!  
 Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah! |1| Why not? 
 Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means were unhappy forever. Sound good? |2| What?! 
 Hey, man! |8| Hey! 
 Flashdance. |7| There was a seen in Footloose... 
 Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we cant leave in the small apartment after weve lived here! Didnt you ever read Flowers for Algernon? |5| Wait-wait-wait-wait!  Come on! Come on, lets trade! The timings perfect, I just clogged the toilet! 
 What?! |3| Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!! 
 Thank you for that!  I was not flirting. |8| Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl! 
 How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out? |4| I love the "I forgot the present" fake out! 
 Yes, we dont get married unless theres a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight  then theres a definite sign that we should get married. |2| Thats a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you! 
 Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys. |3| Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee. 
 Thats a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room. |9| Listen, we dont have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together. 
 Okay. |5| Okay, get ready to owe me! 
 Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some coleslaw, some beans, and a CokeDiet Coke.  _B_ |7| Hey Joe!  
 Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five!  |7| Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?! 
 Ill take a card. |6| Choose, you jackass! 
 Hello? Hello?  |0|  I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?  
 And no kissing your neck. |8| Huh, and no cuddling. 
 Enunciate! |0| Sure... 
 Hey Joe! |9| Chandler walks into Joey's apartment] 
 You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think. |6| Oh! It's not good. 
  F-hah.... flennin.... |6| No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part? 
 I just think it's weird, you know?  Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles  Would you knock it off?   Bah!  Commercial Break _B_ |7| So, you were both dorks. Big deal. 
 That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi! |0| Okay.  All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard!  Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand! _B_ 
 Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding. _B_ |8| It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly. 
 So uhh, how's the palace? |7| Hey. 
 Ok, that's me. _B_ |3| Dennis. 
 Well, your gonna need much bigger jars. |6| I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies. 
 Yeah, thatd be much worse than being 28, and still working here. |0| I dont know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just dont want to be 30 and still work here. 
 I dont know.  I cant tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly. |1| Well yeah, dont-dont you think its a she? 
 All right look, if youre not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all! |2| Yeah! You did! And thats why Im leaving.  
 Well, that is what happened, and I dont even see you denying this! |3| Oh, wow. I cant believe youre throwing that in my face. 
 OhI don't know. |3| Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place? 
 It was my racquet. |0| I was frustrated. 
 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that?  I kinda have a dream! I dont want to talk about it. |7| All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream,  but I don't want to talk about it.  
 Glass, sand, whatever.  |7| What?! 
 Wait a minute, I cant give this to her. |3| Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.  
 Oh right, your allergies.  All her, she hates you.  _B_ |0| Wh?! What about my allergies?! 
 Hey! So are you enjoying the bike? |8| Oh hi! 
 If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway? |2| Hey!  
 |6| Well, its a funny story. 
 That was her. |5| How about the place settings? 
 Shh!  Nice to see you again.  Airline |7| Oh my God! Oranges! 
 Were on a semi-first name basis. Mr. |4| Oh then you know each other. 
 You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants! |2| Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots dont really go with it. 
 Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here? |3| I dont know. Ooh, I bet its Richard. 
 Joey said that youre in here with another man! |8| What are you saying? 
 You do? That's fantastic! |8| I have a badge in it. 
 Of course it was! |7| Yes! 
 I know. He has your eyes.  |7|  Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you!  Oh, we are so lucky! 
 I know. He has your eyes.  |7|  Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you!  Oh, we are so lucky! 
 Hey. |8| Hey. 
 Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh! |1| No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ? 
 So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down. Rachel and |6| Honey, this will help.  
 Thanks |9| Here you go. 
 Youre our age! |8| Okay. 
 How little?! |5|  Im really sorry but I may be a little while longer. 
 I have to; hes my best friend, and youre seeing him. |9| Can you really do that? 
 Tonight, on a very special Blossom. Commercial Break _B_ |8| Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD. 
 She was a welder. |4| Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl 
 Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats. |3| Yes! Didnt you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didnt read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight! 
 Well, you do want all that stuff, right? |7| Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff. 
  So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun? |3| Oh.  Ohhhhhhhhh . _B_ 
 Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever! |2| Oh that's okay. Dont worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back. 
 Sounds great. |9| All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we dont get married. 
 We dont have to come up with this now. |5| Totally!  
 No! No! No! Noone can beat me.  |0| Okay, here we go. Ready? _B_ 
 What'? |3| Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside.  You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. 
 Well Ive been playing it for like eight hours, itll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, theyre dirty words. |5| What is the matter with your hand? 
 So how's Mindy? |8|  Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you?  Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great.  Really?  Oh.  Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and...  Okay...  Great...  Great...  All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow!  Okay..  Okay...  Bye.  Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. 
 And lots of kissing your neck. _B_ |9| Oh good, I hate it when you do that 
 Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested. |3| What's up? 
 Yeah, wow. |6| Wow. 
 Mike didn't tell you? You have to choose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out. |9| I decided to pee. 
 That is a bad interview. |1| Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren. 
 I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does. |1| I know. He has your eyes.  
  Oh, no-no-no-no-no.... |2| Oh.... my God. 
 I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does. |1| I know. He has your eyes.  
 Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them.  Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did. |3|  Have you been here all night? 
  Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.  |8| Hey, hey, look at that talent.  
 Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news. |2| You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes? 
 Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend. |2| Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head. _B_ 
 Excuse me? |1| Well, anyway, I got to go change, Im ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks. 
 All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday? |5| Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!" 
 What? |4| When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down! 
 Yeah, well, dont expect that to happen anytime soon! Commercial Break _B_ |4| Ill tell you what, Chandler, why dont you call me when you grow up! 
 Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef. Fat |9| Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese? 
 If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night. |3| I was frustrated with you! 
 Oh my God!  |4| That was my dad! 
 You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!  I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.   Anyway we're talking about your dream.  I love you.  Your dream?  |9| Well, it involved Monica. 
 Really?! |5| Really?! 
 See? Now, thats why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking. _B_ |1| No! No! No! Noone can beat me.  
 Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom. |1| Why not? 
 As crazy as soccer?  |8| Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be? 
 Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable. |1| It's too cold. 
 I think its the dying cat parade. |5| What is that? 
 I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop? |3| What did you do? 
 Yes, of course.  Airline |6| Uh sir, may I see your tickets please? 
 Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I dont know if he has what it takes. Mr. |1| What do you think of adding him to our team? 
 Okay. |5| Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, Ill wear the boots. In fact, Ill go into my room right now and yknow try the outfit on. 
 And here we go |9| Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe shes having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or! 
 Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack. |7| Its awfully pink.  _B_ 
 This game is kinda fun. |6| What?! 
 Ahh, merry Christmas; I miss you guys! |4|  Ble-blah-blar Blargh!  
 I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you. |5| You wanna see it? 
 RAT BASTARD! |2| Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call me and he didn't. 
 ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by. |8| And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset... 
 Wait-wait-wait-wait! |0|  Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.  
 Well this one's for you. |7| How come you have two? 
 Well, there you go. |6| Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know. 
  Wellll? |0| No, no, that wont be ah, that wont be necessary  
 Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!! |2| No, y'know what dont close it  cause the... keys...are in there. 
 What check thing? |6| Hey Mon, lets give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable. 
 Look, this isnt funny! You get back here right now! |7| A couple of hours, I feel awful. 
  Oh-no-no-no! Dont! Dont! See-see, youre getting me confused, Im starting to urn. |0| Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you 
 She has a real name. |5|  Nana? 
 That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night. |7| Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands... 
 Screw the Knicks! |0| Its the Knicks! 
 Your work makes me sad. |1| Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day. 
 Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever! |7| Oh and you know what I want! 
 Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you  |3| I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that. 
 What-what Richard thing? |9|  Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing. 
 Hey, yknow what? Why dont we think about changes we can make in the living room? |6| Oh good. 
 I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey! |3| Really, ythink so? I dont..  Commercial Break _B_ 
 Because its awesome. |9| Chandler, why would you do that? 
 Whats he doing? |4| Alright, alright. Then maybe you wont mind if me and my friend takes a look around then. Huh! Where you at? _B_ 
  I'm sorry man. |0|  Oh. 
 Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party. |6| Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much! 
 Okay. |5| We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.  
 Okay. |5| We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.  
 Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction. |3| Chandler, Heckles was a nut case. 
 Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie. |6| Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out? 
 This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story. |1| That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say. 
 Don't play with his things. |4| Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice. _B_ 
 Then I got all needy and clingy. |2| That is never good. 
 Bye-bye.  |3| All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys. 
 I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick! |4| What? 
 For three years? |1| She didn't have a birthday while we were going out. 
 All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down.  What? |2| Yeah! But if wouldve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldnt have worried about it so much! See you around! 
 Its the theme from Good Will Humping. |1| Whats that song? It has been in my head all day long. 
 Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight. _B_ |2| Y'know what really bothers me? Isit's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!"  I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up. 
 More coffee over here, please! Commercial Break _B_ |5| Whoa, store will be open tomorrow! 
  So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time? |5| It's no big deal, I do it all the time. 
 Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down! |1| Noooooooo! _B_ 
 I am proud of all my friends today. |9| Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip shed heard all year. 
 You didnt get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?  |7| Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I dont think its the kind youre gonna like. 
 You mean you didnt get it from this? |2|  Hello?  What are you talking about? The auditions not til 500!  Well, nobody told me!  Whod you talk to?  Nevermind!  
 And I don't wanna say this, I don't want you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go.  Oh my god!! _B_ |0|  It hurts my teeth. 
  Oh my God! |4| It sounds like its coming from across the street. 
 Oh thats all right, I have it memorized. Its 1A. Airline |6| Im sorry, would you move your thumb? I cant see the seat number. 
 But this is eleven. Its almost twice as hard up here. Mr. |4| Really? They love him down on six. 
 Im in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think theres something wrong. |1| Hello? 
 I dont think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other. _B_ |2|  You dont think its a little crazy that you get all my points just cause you 
 Hell is filled with people like you. |5| Brrrrrrr!  
 Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy. |1| So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard? 
 What? |4| What?!? 
 OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO!  No! |0| So you're not friends with him? Monica and 
 Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink. Girl No. 2 So what are you guys out doing today? |2| Wait! Wait! _B_ Girl No. 1 Hey, you. He's just adorable. 
 No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, _B_ it's about you and me and the fact that we're _B_ best buds. |6| Get out. 
 You got a Cheeto on your face man._B_ _B_ |4| Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax. 
 Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'!  Don't worry, those are the right letters. |5| Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember? 
 Mar-haaaan. _B_ |6| Mar-gha. 
 What do we do? What do we do? |2| Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
  My lighters in there!  Commercial Break _B_ |7| Whats going on? 
  Pete Becker. Pete   Is this him? |5| As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so Id call him. 
 Could I borrow it? _B_ |5| Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face  and her chest  I could really put something together. 
 Why not?! |4| I cant!! 
 I-I think we have too. |9| Im sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try. 
 Althea?! What are you doing?! |8|  Althea! 
 Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing. |9| Really. 
 I didnt mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more. |3| Whoa! 
  Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluidOp! Op!  |9| Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing. 
 Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?! |0| I do not have baby fever! 
 What Richard thing? |5| Oh no. _B_ 
 Ready! |8| Ready? 
 Yeah, I mean were gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.  |4| Changes? 
  All right.  I thought about it and maybe youre right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy. |0| How are you still single?! 
 It happened in London. |5| How?! When?! 
 What are you doing? |8| So you uh, nervous about getting married? 
 Well yknow, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge. |4| You think this is clever? 
  Yeah! I... I... I liked it!  But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches! |0|  But, ehm... you watched the tape? 
 Not for me it doesn’t.  Agency |3|  Being a doctor must take up a lot of time. 
 No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee. |5| I know. This is really, really huge. 
 What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it supposably? |0| All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go. 
 Uh, Julie. |5| Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks.   
 Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback. |3| No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen. 
 Buddy? |6| Where's Buddy? 
 She said she'd call me. Rachel and |0| Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it? 
 Ah, I dont know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me. |7|  Hows my Bing-a-ling? 
 What, what, what?! |3| Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica! 
 Damn!  The tailpipes not hot enough to light this! |2|  My lighters in there!  Commercial Break _B_ 
 You dont think I get up when you get up? |3| Hey! Who was up from 2 oclock this morning until 5 oclock this morning trying to get her back to sleep? 
 All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay? |2|  Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I... 
 What does she do? |1| Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type. 
 What are you guys doing out here? |7| You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!  
 Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am. |4| Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you! 
 Hi, Im Chandler. Your live-in boy |9| My God, Rachel, I cant believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, Im so jealous.  
 Those are my gifts, I got them for you. |8| Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap! 
 Okay. Okay.  Yes honey, I made it myself.  I cant do it. I cant do it.  Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!  _B_ |5| Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.  _B_ 
 Well, maybe we can fix it yknow? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him! |5| The allergy guy got the part! Thanks! 
 Yeah! You? |9| Are you still awake? 
 Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress. |6| Right, okay, then no. _B_ 
 Yknow that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "Youre half Scottish right?" |1| What? 
 Apology accepted. Excuse us.  Airline |1|  Sir, this is not a first class ticket. Im sorry. 
 I think its best sir. Mr. |9| Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put. 
 Im in the bathtub. |4| You know what? I-I think Ill wait out here. 
 Alright, well, Ill check the guest bedroom. _B_ |6| Bedrooms clear, although you might need some new pillows. 
 It is. Did I... not tell you about her? |1| Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name. 
 Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not. |8| We're okay. I'm still ovulating. 
 I got nothing. _B_ |0| I'm adopted?  
 How do you feel? |6| I'm really happy for you guys. 
 How do you feel? |6| I'm really happy for you guys. 
 People do stupid things when they're upset. |0| Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad. 
  You done? |4| Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff. 
 That's what they'll call us. _B_ |2| Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies. 
 I want you to say that you like her! |5| Look, what do you want me to say? 
 Well, my apartment isnt there anymore, because I drank it. |5| How ya feelin? 
 Like an eclipse.  _B_ |6| Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it. 
 Whos he huggin? |5| Thats Bill Clinton. 
 What?! |3| Im in my bosss car! 
 Bye.  Are you still out there? |9| Okay. Bye. 
 Oh, you must stop shooping. |9| I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop. 
 You're shooting with Althea?! |7| I took a shot. 
 With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that. |4| What, uh... what juggling thing? 
 And the Knicks rule all. |9| Huh. 
 Ooooohh! |9| Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.  _B_ Joey and 
 Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head! |8| Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap! 
  Yes, yes eight.  |7|  Come on eight. 
 Is that a problem? |2| Youre-youre-youre gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here? 
 I swallowed the sonic blaster gun. |4| Good. What made you change your mind? 
 Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts? |9| Okay. Okay.  Yes honey, I made it myself.  I cant do it. I cant do it.  Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!!  _B_ 
 Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.  |4| Well it was Chandler! We didnt think hed ever propose! 
  What happened? Im just eating candy. |6| See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And there is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs.  Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing! 
 The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it. |1| IN LONDON!!! 
 Okay. I cant believe tomorrows the big day. |4| Look, look lets pretend its a real bachelor party. Okay? Yknow? Before your wedding. Come on, itll be fun. 
 It is when you put it together with that one. |5| Hey wait a minute, this one isnt dirty. 
 What problem did you tell him you had? |3| Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again. 
 Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?  |8| Really! 
  What!? Of course I did! |7|  You didn't watch the tape. 
 Uh, Rach? |9|  Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing. 
 OK, is there a mute button on this woman? |1| Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again. 
 How do you know that? How? |3| Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody. 
 Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright. |4| Yeah? 
 There was no fish when she dropped it off. |0| My fish, Buddy. 
 That, that's what's stupid. |0| It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid. 
 Oh God. |2| Ohh!  
 You tell me! Maybe, its because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!! |1| Why are your eyes so white? 
 You really think that is what he meant? |4| What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look,  'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase! 
 Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning. |3| Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger? 
 Yes, here it comes! Im stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I dont think so mister! |4| Ohhh, here it comes. 
 Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times hes wrong. |3| He is right, isnt he? 
 Would you like me to write her a little poem as well? |6| Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card? 
 Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy? |1| No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination. 
 Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable. |1| Yeah! 
  Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that. |2| Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off. 
  I'm not mad. |2| Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary. 
 So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk? |9| Thank you. Uh... 
 Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.  |6| Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.  
 I know, lets rest and drink lots of fluids.  |4| Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Lets do something crazy! 
 I messed up. Okay? Im sorry, I really messed up. |0| How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part couldve turned my whole career around! 
  Youve reached Monica and Chandlers, if youre listening to this message, were probably screening.  Yeah we are. The Museum |7|  Thank you, its my moms. So this is the kitchen.  _B_ 
 Mr. D, hows it going, sir? Mr. |2| Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.  _B_ 
  Yeah?  I hope youre not thinking about cleaning the living room. _B_ |6| You do know that was me who just said that right?  Hey. As long as were both up 
 See?  Here we go.  Mr. |7| Yay! 
 Yes!! _B_ Commercial Break _B_ |7| Nooo!! 
 Hi dad. |9|  Hello all! 
 What size shoes do you wear? |6| Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I wouldve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and thats just for ugly people. 
 Yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em. Mr. |4| But we really do need to find someone up here. The work is starting to pile up. Ive got a stack of documents on my desk this high.  
 I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The waters tepid. The salt didnt dissolve and is now lodged places. And the scents I used dont compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomileOh! |7| Oh.  Whats wrong? 
 Mento? |6| Yeah, so far nothing stupid. 
 ...And boogie! |9| Get down? 
 I send them home. |3| Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about new year's eve. Where is everybody else? 
 I - I don't think I can. |3| So, let's do this. 
 Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though. _B_ |6| What was that? 
 Actually, we already found a house we love. |6|  It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.  
 Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in. |9| Phoebe here with the cab yet? 
 Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room. |2| Wow. 
 You had to ask. |6| The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that. 
 Thanks for trying.  Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore! |3| I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna  pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her. 
  Does this mean were gonna have to start paying for coffee?  Commercial Break _B_ |2| Gunther, I quit. 
 This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program! |5| Oh my God! Thats Pete! But why is Bill huggin Pete? 
 Nice shooting!  |8| Althea is correct. 
 Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...  |0| No. 
  Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!! |0| Bye Chandler!   I miss you already.  
 Well, I did not know that. Commercial Break _B_ |2| You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!  
 No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud. |3| No! 
 Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women? |1| Chandler, this actually bothers you? 
 Oh, thats cool. Then Ill just bring them both over. |7| Well, its a set and they should probably stay together. 
 Hey! |8| Bastard! _B_ 
 Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Yknow? And it turns out I was wrong. And now its lodged in my throat.   |0| How did that happen?!! 
 Those are book ends! That's a great gift! |9| Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing? 
 Phoebe Buffay in |7| What?!!  
 Okay, come here! Come here. |5| Sure! Okay, you go first. 
 Just tell her the truth! Tell her youre not ready. |6| You dont understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, Im not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her? 
 Absolutely! Yknow, because tushie can mean both ass and good worker. |9| Maybe its not as bad as I think. Yknow, maybe they didnt take it the way I meant it. 
 My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!  |8| Oh yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people. Ive been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself and no ones even looked up from their desk. Hang-hang on.  Hey everybody! Uh, Im gonna kill myself!  Ill get back to ya.  I got nothing. Wait.  Uh, hey Marge!   Ehh, nothing. Nothing. _B_ 
 No-no-no-no-no! You can't! |0| But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!  
 Youre right, this is more fun.  |7| How does it feel knowing youre never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing youre gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death. 
 Come on, he wont even know what they mean. |2| Ah, well if you dont clear this off, you wont be getting one of those from me. But Bens coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this cant be there. 
 I'm not lying to you, I watched it! |4| Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me? 
 Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us? Agency |1| Do you have any question for Erica? 
 You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays? |5| I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out. 
 So how'd it go? |4| That was 14 hours ago. 
 Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie..._B_ Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon? _B_ _B_ |7| Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy? 
 This ice cream tastes like crap by the way. |2| Welcome to our side of the tunnel. 
 All right! |7| Oh my God!! 
 Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone. |5| Yeah. 
 And you dont think taking care of our chick is work? |8| Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day! 
 Oh, no- |5| Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.   
 Oh-no, hes right. Commercial Break _B_ |0| You think? 
  Rachel, could I see you for a moment?  |8|   What?! 
 No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.  |5| Chandler, will you just come in already? 
 No. No. Were not gonna do that, yknow why? Because its not an even trade. |0| Hey, so? Are you gonna do it? 
 Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. |2| Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this. 
 It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable. Ross and |1| Well, I did not know that. Commercial Break _B_ 
 Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.  |8| Really?! 
 That was so unlikely. Well, lets get married! I guess. |1| Wow! I cant believe I actually rolled an eight. 
 That would be impossible to resist if you werent all drippy here.  |4| Okay, Ill rest. But yknow if Im going to bed, then youre coming with me. 
 Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybodys allowed one mistake, right? _B_ |1| Hey, you dont even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine! 
  This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groomNo! Not the groom!! Commercial Break _B_ |9|  Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. Im calling for Monica Geller. I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available  
 And? Mr. |2| Ohh, its been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in. 
 Why is your family Ross?! |1| No, there is no way! It can not be Ross!  Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?! 
 Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume? |3| Uh, eleven, eleven and a half. 
 What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?! _B_ |0|  Thats a good one.  
 The bath salts! Theyre starting to effervesce! Its different.  Its interesting. |0| What? 
 Nobody here, Joe. |4| Oh yeah, I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier. _B_ 
 Uhh, uh... |3| Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty? 
 Because of Emma. |4| Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute. 
  Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you.  |4| I really made you think about that thing uh? 
 You know it? |5| Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk. 
 Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time. _B_ |5| Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7. 
 Oh, yeah? |6| I miss Rose. 
 Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare. |7| Oh, now it's a spare room? 
  Hey! |8| Hey!  
 I spelled out boobies. |4| ....and 12, 22, 18, four...  What? 
 There you go!! |6| We use it!! 
 Yes! |8| Ohh!! 
 Okay, heres the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit. |8|  Rachel, could I see you for a moment?  
 Well, like father, like son. |6|  Chandler!! You have the best taste in men! 
 Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.  |1| Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size. 
  Hello children! |9| Ahhhhhhhhhh , and lower it a couple of inches, so that the fingers are pointing at your wrist. Now take your arms and keeping the elbows bent and your hands in front of you spread out your arms, kinda like making a bird's wing. Now hunch your shoulders over and move you hands up and down as if you are trying to tell some one to turn it down. That's Ross 'quiet down' maneuver. Well, there is an accompanying face, but I don't want to try and describe it as well.) 
 Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me? |1| Actually, I did! 
 Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! Ill get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work! |3| See now-now youre taking them away from their home. 
 Thats great, but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now? |2|  Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and Ill have my health insurance back in no time. 
 Now, its not wrapped because I just, just finished it. |2| Okay!  
 Then you distract her with a Barbie doll. |4| I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset? 
 You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap! |0| Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybodys allowed one mistake, right? _B_ 
 Have you talked to him lately? |4| Chandler! Hes seven; hes not stupid. 
 I can't believe you want us to raise Emma! |0| Well, we haven't officially asked them yet, but, we would want Monica and Chandler. 
 I doubt that! Tell her about us last year. |6| Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever. 
 I watched it! |9| Well, you lied again!  
 You should be. You’re really on top of stuff.. Agency |6| Yes, our system assures total anonymity. We’re very proud of it. 
 Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh? TIME LAPSE |1| And about an hour ago, we made an offer.  
 Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla! |8| Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good.  Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow. 
 Yeah, I understand. |6| Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place? 
 Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin. |1| Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'? 
 Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here? |9| Hey pal. 
 Night-night.....Janice.  'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom!  Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'  Commercial Break _B_ |1| Night-night Bing-a-ling. 
 Joey told me, he saw you two kissing. |5| How did you know? 
 Ow, no woo-hooing, no woo-hooing. |1| Woooo hoooo!!! 
  Hey, my Fathers house does that! |7| Ahhhh!! 
 I know what you meant!!  You notice that ever since we got this chick, weve been fighting a lot more than we used too? |8| Thats not what I said. Okay, I just meant... 
 Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.  |3| Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter. 
 Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.  |2| Look out, incoming pumpkin pie! 
  Thanks! |9| All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! Its not like hes Chandler! 
 Damn Rollos! |9| Yeah, well that's how mad I am!! Commercial Break _B_ 
 Emotional Knapsack? |8| So Im thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week. 
 By me? |3| Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely. 
 What's going on? |2| Is everything okay? 
 Thats right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit! |2| Wait a minute. That wasnt a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight. 
 What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning! |3|  Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what cha doin? 
 Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay? |4| Ha! 
 Yeah, I dont you should say that even when youre healthy. |5|  Are you saying that you dont wanna get with this?  
 I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad. |3| Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand 
 So what does this mean? Mr. |2| Its pretty ugly. We havent seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies. 
  Phil. |6|  Paul! 
 If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang. _B_ |6| He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! Its not even a song! 
  Those arent eleven and a half. |6| Uh, I dont even really know where I left those. Sorry. 
 Hi.  |8| Hi! 
 Good game! |8| Okay, dinners ready! 
 Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh! |8| Okay, lets talk about something else. 
 I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching?  Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.  |1| Awesome! _B_ 
 I don't know! |2|  Answer faster, answer faster! 
 Sorry. |0| Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone. 
 No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room. |2|  Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get. 
  H-He's in China! |4| Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.  
 Oh, sure, they love us over there. Girl No. 2 Where's your baby? Chandler and |3| Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?  Girl No. 1 So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's? 
 Hey. |8| Hey, here she comes. 
 Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair? |8| Well I uh, got what I came for. _B_ I'll uh, I'll see you guys. 
 I think you played the Gunther card too soon. _B_ |7| Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again. 
 Oh, dont thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.  |0| Thank you soo, much. 
  What is with him? |4| Bing!  Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun.  Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on.  Wham!  Good one. That was a good one.  Keep at it team.  
 I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well! |2| You promised you would break up with her! 
 Really?! I-I thought you werent looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling. |3| Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious. 
 Okay.  |5| Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please? 
 Are you serious? |2| Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us! 
 In the game room! |6| Yeah-yeah, yknow what? Yeah, thats it-thats it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! Thats-thats what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! Im talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesnt match! Where is it gonna go?! 
 Whats wrong with you? |6| What?! 
 But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs. |7| Okay. 
 Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. _B_ |5| It's not that bad. 
  Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?  |5|  I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours. 
 No-no-no, if you unplug it, Ill have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work.  No!  Hey look at that! Look at that, its still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM  Chip in it or something! |0| All right, look Im just gonna unplug it. 
  I did! |8| Keep going Pinocchio! 
 It feels like we’re cheating on our house. And if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won’t do? |4| Thanks. 
 Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!  _B_ |7| You know it's twins, right? 
 Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!  _B_ |7| You know it's twins, right? 
 You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man. |1| You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right? 
 You can tell us. |6| Yeah. 
 Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained. |0| Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then. 
 Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it. |8| Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment. 
 Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything? |4| Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic! 
 Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas. |4| What a phony. 
 So, you don't think I'm terminal? |1| Yeah, you do. 
 No! In his office! How many kisses were there? |7| In the park? 
 Ah, I fooled around with Joeys sister.  Well, thats not the worst part. |0| Why, what happened? 
 Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and theres nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening. |7|  O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything. 
 Ill take her back tomorrow. |3| I dont know, maybe we werent ready to have a chick. 
 Hey. |8| Hey, you're back! 
 Right on! Oh! Uh, but, dont take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez. |1| Yeah. 
 Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her? |7| Um-hmm. 
 Uh, yeah. |3| Okay.  Chandler? Can I see you for a second? 
 Yeah.  Were doing the right thing, right? |8| I wanted it so bad!  Wanna go pack? 
 Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back. |0| Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff? 
 Dont take this personally okay? Its just that I just cant have sex with a sick person. |1|  Come on.  
 Uh-oh, its my boss! |4|  Hey there you are! 
  One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all.  I remembered it.  The champagne is here.  |9| What are you doing? 
 Daddy. All right look, heres the story.  Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy.  So I take off my glasses and thats when it happened. _B_ |1| And what did he ask you not to call him? 
 Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash; Mr. |3| Well, were gonna be layin off people in every department. 
 Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed.  Okay,  youre doing great. Youre doing great. Youre doing fine.  |9| Phil! 
 So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet? |5| NOW!!!!!!!!  _B_ 
 Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort. |9| Yeah. 
 I had the exact same conversation. |1| Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and 
 I cant even believe this! I really come off that badly? |0| Oh okay, I see what youre doing there. _B_ 
 Don't judge me, I'm only human! |4| Hey dude, what's up? 
 I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague. |4|  Answer better, answer better! 
 Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it. |0| Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age? 
 Word! |8| Seriously? 
 Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they? |4| Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with... 
 _B_ I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? _B_ |0| Ok, that's so nice. _B_ 
 It's the Miracle Wax. |6| Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint? 
 Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness. |5| C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big! 
 It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out. |4| And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?! 
 Hey. |8| Oh, would you let it go already?! Youre fine!  
 Ummmmmmmm, no. |3| Well, y'know, possibly.  You didnt tell him that, though? Right? 
 Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened. |1| I kinda feel like it's my fault.  
  Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging bicepsShe knows! Commercial Break _B_ |0| Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it! 
 All right! Thats fine! Thats fine! I wont bring over the chairs! I wont bring anything over! I wouldnt want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandmas place!!  _B_ |6| Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly! 
 This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-you go to the doctor! |3| Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since. But um, I dont think its anything serious. 
 Oh, yes. Well its very beautiful. Its cream-colored and tight _B_ I dont mean tight, I mean its not too tight, not that I was looking at-_B_ Mr. |7| Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it. 
  Maybe well have to listen and see! |8| Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?! 
 I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . _B_ Hi! _B_ |2| Chandler, Chandler. 
 I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. Shes saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to  Dollywood. |6| I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it? 
 Guys? |5| Daddy. All right look, heres the story.  Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy.  So I take off my glasses and thats when it happened. _B_ 
 What is the matter with you? |6| Oh my God! Joey! 
 Do you know what just happened? |1| What?! What are you doing?! 
 Oh my God!  _B_ Mr. |4| Dont you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that? 
 Thats me. |5| Uh, that-thats-thats me! 
 With the claw?! |7| Honey you-you got to beat your scores! 
 Hey!  I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks. |3| You gotta be at least bi...  _B_ 
  I'm telling you, I watched the tape.  |4|  No you didn't!  
 I know this is really hard and we're really sorry. |3| Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers? 
 Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good. |8| I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before. 
 What about the time difference? |4| No, no, wait.  His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes. 
 Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good. |8| I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before. 
  Hi, it's me. |9| Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably. _B_ 
 What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie. |5| Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . . _B_ 
 Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord. Chandler and |5| Ben! 
 Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while. |4| Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love. 
 Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now? |0| Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one. 
 Okay, okay. So, should I call her? Rachel and |7| Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control. 
 Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!! |0| Just those two! 
 I cant remember which sister. |7| What is the worse part? 
 Of course, I didnt get to enjoy any of that, because Joannas such a big, dull dud! _B_ |0| Hmm. 
 Well, thats not true, he-he smacked you once. |3| We never get smacked. 
 Actually, its Miss Chinandolor Bong. _B_ |7| I knew that! Rachel! Use youre head! 
 It was terrible. I fought with  my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?  |0| How was your conference? 
 Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand? |0| All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?  
 Dude, don't do that too me!  |4| Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, Im gonna be out with her all night.

 Well there you have it! |9|  Not really. 
 Why? |4| Okay.  We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.} 
 Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen? |2| I am so attracted to him right now. _B_ 
 Yes I'm gonna put it back  exactly where I found it. |2| Put it back exactly where you found it? 
 How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day? |4| Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...  _B_ 
 Thats the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe. _B_ |3| Im with you Chandler! I mean I cant have sex with a sick person either, thats disgusting! But Im not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe. 
  Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans. |5| All right, heres a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work Im delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!

 Monicas a little drunk. |2| Hey, whats going on? 
 Huh. |5| Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying shed like to go out again. 
 I dont know! Joey hasnt had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth! |3| You did? What was he talking about? 
 Oh good. Good, because Im sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks. |3| Oh! Its okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are. 
 I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it? |3| Did you take that tape? 
 You know guys, I gotta say this, this means so much to me. That you'd trust me, with your child...I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own, and I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but...that you two....that you two... |6| Connected? I mean...To what? She's a lump! 
 I climb down the fire escape, and you cant put that in the closet? _B_ _B_ |6| Wait, wait, wait a minute. If youve just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here? _B_

 Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families. MR. |6| Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday? 
  What? _B_ |4| Oh yeah, sure, that too.  
 I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesnt matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. Its so annoying. Does it bug you? |0| It does in mine! _B_ 
 Hey! |8|  Hey! 
 Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker. |8| Okay.  Ooh, y'know we could just do this.  
 No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I cant get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and Im cold, and  |4| Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them. 
 No, I almost did, couldnt leave Ross there without a spotter! |8| Hey! So, did you quit? 
 Why not?! Id be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to getoh I see. |5| You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You dont tell the guy that! 
 They dont really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.  |4| Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you  about, cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me. 
 Well, I think it's very brave what you said.  |3| Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!  
 Uh, HELLO!! |4| Uh-huh. Thank Joey! 
 Thats a hernia. |5| No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!

  No! |2| Did you watch the tape? 
 Yeah, I did. |5| Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that? 
  You know that's not the reason Joe.  |3| Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food?  Because I can stop doing that,  I really, really think I can! 
 Yes!  You're never gonna make it! |8| From here to the airport? 
 Eeeshk. |6| Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk. 
 What? |4| Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it. 
 Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time... |3| Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac! 
  Have you seen Joey? |8| Which you just gave up really quickly. 
  Here.  |5| Oh, Im sorry honey, Im so, so,  haaaaa! Im so, so sorry, I just  haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I cant breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?

 You mean this.  |8| No, the quiet down thing! 
 No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister. |0| All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.  
 And a date with a man! |9| Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part. 
 Phoebe knows about us! |6| Yeah? 
 Ohh, so? |5| 'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are! 
 Well, Joeys my best friend. |8| Soon! I-I just couldnt before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldnt do that to her, shes my best friend! 
 She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place. |0| Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping. 
  What? |4|  I think hes stoned again. 
 Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.  |1| I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's. 
 What? |4|  You realize what you are dont you? 
 No! No! No! I just kissed her. |0| And what?! Did you sleep with her?! 
 Oh, yeah.  Uh, no you cant have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you shouldve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay? |1| Yeah. Im okay. Im actuallyIm a little cold, can I have your jacket? 
  I dont think thats what they were talking about Joe!! |5| Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!! 
 Can you figure out what Im doing? |5| Chandler!  Chandler! I just figured out who you are! 
  Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me. |3| Are you okay? 
 Hey! |8|  Hey!

 Oh uh, as it turns out, we cant do it. Monica has to work. |3| Bing! Were all set for tonight, 8 oclock. 
 All right, lets break this down. What exactly did he say to you? |2|  That was a long night. 
 Cheese you say? Thats some pretty smelly work, huh Don? |1| so Ive been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things. 
 An hour. |4| All right, dont freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave? 
 Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch! |9| Youve got to be kidding me! Commercial Break _B_ 
 Some girl...!? |5| I don't know. Who'm I'm married to? 
 BE-LOW me! |6| She did WHAT? 
 Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for? |2| I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so... 
 I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day! _B_ |1| Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late! 
 I think these are yours. |6|  Yeah! 
 Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered. |8|  Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass. 
 Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend? |5| Janice? You called Janice? 
 So, how many have you sold so far? |4|  Oh God!  
 Okay! You dont think I thought of that? |2| Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, hes actually going to kill you dead. 
 Is there any chance you didnt see that? Commercial Break _B_ |3| You bug me. _B_ 
 Hey. |8| ...Chandler! 
 Never! |6| Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it!  You never see Joanna again! 
 Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing? |6| All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.  
 So what are you gonna do? |5| Thanks Rach.  
 Monica.  |7| Gunther, can I get a coffee  to go? 
 Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it? |5| No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have? 
  You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! Ill be living here.  |7| Whoa!! Now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay? 
 Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?  |2| This sucks man! The last night youre here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500. 
 Yeah! |8| Okay, you ready to open yours? 
 I know. |5| Oh my God Chandler! I cant believe it! 
  Monica? |7| Nooo! No, thats not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked my world!

 Hey! |8|  Hey Chandler! 
 Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee? |2| Why don't you just take it with you? 
 Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met. |8| I know, right?  Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this? 
 We can talk about that. |2| I hear ya. 
  See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks. |4| Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal! 
 Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware. |3| I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore. 
 Your last roommate's kidney? |8| Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is? 
 It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday. MR. |6| Yeah Bing, what's that about? 
 Oh, just this!  Yknow what its my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish. |2| Whats the matter? 
 Ill take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me?  Are you finished with him?  Do you still love him?  Do you still love me?  All right look,  Im gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me?  |2| The receipt. 
 Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number. |3| I think so. 
 Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You cant just stare through the peep hole for three hours! Youre gonna get peep eye! |4| Is there any chance you didnt see that? Commercial Break _B_ 
 No sir. |6|  Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing? 
 Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!" |2| Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here? 
 Hi. |8| Yeah, when were in the audience he doesnt talk to us, but he does wave. _B_ 
 What are the odds? What are the odds?  |2| Yay! Emily!  
 No! |2| All right, so what do you say? 
  All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him! |2| Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn? 
 Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat. Commercial Break _B_ |0| So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong! 
 You just said Of course youre my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though? |7| Im not your best friend? 
 She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it. |7| Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica? 
 Hi, Just Janice. |9| Hello, funny Valentine. 
 How is that worse?! |0| What?!! Thats even worse!! 
 Hey! |8| Hey! 
 Yes! Im fine. In fact Ive been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you. |6|  Are you sure youre okay? 
 Honey, its gonna be okay. |3| Wait, but theres no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!

 Hey! |8| Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!  
 That was weird. |4| All right, whenever youre ready.  
 Oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either. |0| Oh, my ex-wife didnt work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then. 
 Uh-huh. |2| Okay, he was talking about rules. 
 Cheese, its smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too. |8| Excuse me? 
 Phoebe! |8| I cant help you. 
 Oh-ho-ho, yeah! |8| You liked it? You really liked it? 
 Yeah...!? |6| She hot? 
 Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.. |9| I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team. 
 You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window. |0| I guess you're right. 
 Well then maybe you shouldn't go. |3| I-I-I don't know. 
 Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code? |6| Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means. 
 Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody. |1| You remember Janice, right? 
 OK. |5| OK, let's go. 
 Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice. _B_ |6| Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . . 
 So I'm not, not gonna lose her? |1| Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof. 
 Oh my God, how did you do that? |1| Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes! 
 So, what do you thing the good news is? |3| Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news. 
 Fine! |8| You never come into this office again! 
 Were doomed. Okay, theyre gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do? |3| Oh, umm, I was just yknow working out and umm Oh, thats it. 
 Oh, yeah, you have to tell her. |4| You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?  
 Just tell me what I need to do to make things right. |3| I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you. 
 Why did you take the shower curtain down? |4| Oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it. 
 Okay, uh, how about, how aboutyknow what? We could play a new game. A new game, its fun. |3| Nah, not my game. 
 And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight.  You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldnt afford it, because you paid dinner last night. |7| The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting. 
 Its a sock bunny. |5| Okay.  
 Uh-huh. |2| All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge? 
 What?! |3| What? 
 Why do they put so much steam in there?! |1| You gave my father a lap dance! 
 I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right! |7| What?! 
 Uh Joe, when its one oclock in the morning and you dont come by? Thats okay! |2| Listen, sorry I didnt stop by last night but I had a date. 
 Thanks. |9| You too! 
 I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride. |4| Why don't you just call her? 
 Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset? |7| Seriously? She actually said that? 
 Well, she... she didn't win... |5| *What*' 
 You're kidding. |3|  You know there already is a Joseph Stalin? 
 Sure.  You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you? |3|  Can I talk to you alone for a minute? 
 He's open! |5| Pass it! Pass it! 
 Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it. |7| What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie. 
 Whats going on? |4|  Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles. 
 Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about. |1| Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know. 
 You didnt just break up. |5| I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, shed say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does! 
  Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!! |9| Nope.  
 Okay.  Commercial Break _B_ |4| Hey! 
 Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden? |9| Hey! 
 Op, op, Im convinced! |6| Oh, just do it!! 
 Okay.  |5| All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game. 
 Okay.  Oh yes.  |5| All right, all right, at least Im prepared. 
 I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out. |6| Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me. 
 You do? Why? |4| Okay, I think I might know why my parents dont like you. 
 Youre right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line. |1| I dont know! But its the same! 
 Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldnt imagine growing old with  |5| Ohh thats sweet! 
 Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?! |3| Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why? 
 Monicas wasted. |1| Whats-whats going on? Phils really pissed! 
 What are you guys doing?  |8| But audiencesYou have a live studio audience and they must love that. They must love it when they see you guys playing. _B_ 
 Its the semi-finals of her botchy ball tournament. |1| Oh? Why not? 
 He didnt say anything about that to me. |2| Umm, and looking at people differently. 
 Chandler Bing. |9| All right, all right, well just do our best. Okay? So lets say Im the interviewer and Im meeting you for the first time. Okay. "Hi! Come on in, Im uh, Regina Philange." 
 The whole thing! Can we go? |1| Which part exactly? 
 Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head...  Can it? |1| How did she get me to settle down? 
 Im sorry. I told you that I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I didnt didnt know didnt think youd understand. |3| Whats going on? 
 To Ross! All  Ross!  |9| ...that center around work.

 Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again. |1| What?! 
  Well, what is it? |3|  Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out. 
 C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late." |9| Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid. 
 Cups. |5| Well, whats it called? 
 But the Kit-Kats are all right?! |0| No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars. 
 Not really. |3| Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny? 
 Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that were gonna get married. |6| No, yknow what? Its gonna be okay. I mean you dont have to have this rustic Italian feast. Yknow? And-and you dont need, you dont need this custom-made, empire-waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.  
 Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen? |0| Cause otherwise theyd have to call it the room room.

Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great.  Okay.   She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back.  She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back... |0| Do you? 
  Hey. |8| Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay? That’s just what she wants. 
 Yeah! |8| Nooooo! Being funny is your thing! 
 Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably... |4| Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.

 What do we do? |3| Interesting!  Can I see you for a second?  
 What do we do? |3| Interesting!  Can I see you for a second?

 Ill give you a thousand dollars to talk to us. |4| No. Im-Im to depressed to talk. 
 Youre a genius! |9| Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source. 
 Hang on buddy!  |6| Aww man! I cant believe I locked myself out again!  
 Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her? |7| She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you." 
 All right, but you cant use that again for a whole year. Im in. |4| Come on man, you know Id do it for you! Because, youre my best friend. 
 Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea. |1| Oh, it was awful.  I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food. 
 Oh man! |5| And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell! 
 Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.  |5|  Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure? 
 Hey-hey! |4|  Hey! 
 No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now.  Phone's done ehh. |0| Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you. 
 What?! Why did you do that? |0| Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window. 
 Look, Im not saying that you should magically forgive me! But youre not perfect! Youve made some errors in judgment too! |6| Over the line?! You-youre-youre so far past the line, that you-you cant even see the line! The line is a dot to you! _B_ 
 Damn those robots, theyre supposed to be our faithful servants! |3| Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot. 
 No. How are ya Paul?  |6| Rachel? 
  I know, but just let me say it. |6|  Oh my God! 
 What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago. |2| No! But because he thought I was too faaaaa .  And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Yknow, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie. 
  Okay, will you just go help her change please! |4| Maybe that will liven up this party. 
 Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident? |2| Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what! 
 Well now-now youre just talking crazy. |9| Whats going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something? 
 He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules. |7| What did he tell you? 
 Well you should meet my uncle, Bada.  Ill let myself out. _B_ |7| Bing, what an unusual name. 
 I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part! |8| Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics. 
 She's right! If I were a guy and...  Did I just say if I were a guy..? |1| Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this! 
  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!! |5| Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe... 
 Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving. |0| Oh honey... 
 So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before? |7| That's a good point. 
 'Scuse me. |9| Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!  Commercial Break _B_

 You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great!  Ahhh!  |9| Well, then I lost it. You buy me one! 
 They got a breakfast buffet.  |7| Its 930 in the morning! 
 I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud! |0| Well, I do. 
 Hi! |9|  Hey! Ross and 
 Ill teach ya! Come on, come on, its really easy and really, really fun. |8| I dont know how to play Cups. 
 Oh thats too bad. |0| Oh, shes uh-uh really sick. 
 I see. Yknow umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies. |8| Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See thats what this is about. 
 Not that big a deal? There there was touching of things. |4| Come on, its not that big a deal! 
 Oh its always nicer to hear than, "Aw crap! You again!" |0| Hey! Good, youre home! 
 Yeah!  No! No! No! Dont fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee.  And I probably wont spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor. |1| Give me the good stuff. 
 Whend you meet her? |7| Yeah! 
 A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head? |2| Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!  
 Well this one's for you. |7| How come you have two? 
 'S'why I'm dancing... _B_ |7| Don't you have to pee? 
 Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute? |5| Hey. 
 Ye....  |6| Without that, you just got "lame with women". 
 Then you're gonna have to watch it for me. |7| if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya... 
 Honey, there's really nothing to worry about. |3|  Oh Chandler, stop talking! 
  Twins! Twins!! |9| What do you mean "what do we do"? 
  Twins! Twins!! |9| What do you mean "what do we do"? 
 Janice, you're |7| Hey, it's everybody. 
 Fine with me. |6| Well then maybe I will. 
 Well, I'm going to kill you. |3| Joseph's good, isn't he? 
 C'mon, we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!! |6| He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there! 
 He started mine first! |3| Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it. 
 Math!! Youre giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, well see who gets her. _B_ |4| Well I dont like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Dont feel bad man, we all have our strengths. Youre better with numbers and stuff. 
 Me! On my computer. |2| Well hey, who did these resumes for ya? 
  You see you cant tell which one is which either, dwha!! |5| No, no, no, thats Dina. 
 Your liking it, huh? |9| These little women. Wow! 
 Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us. |1|  Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there. 
 Okay. |5| Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, Im gonna kill myself, I swear. I cant, I cant watch this.  Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, shes going in. 
 Now, theres two reasons. |0| Aww, man, now we wont be bank buddies! 
 I sure did. |4|  Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this? 
 Unfortunately that is correct. The |1| Viva Las Gaygas! 
 Monica.  _B_ |7| Chandler!  
 Okay, so he's out of here. |7|  Uh fellas,  
 That's patio furniture! |7| Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?  
 I am now! |9| These arent for you! Are you upset? 
 Hey Mon, how's it going? |9|  Hi! 
 How could it not matter?! |1| I dont know, aheh, yours was the first name that-that popped into my head, Im Im sorry. I-I didnt think it would matter. 
  What happened?!! |2| Name one! _B_ 
 No, did he hug you?! |0|  Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you? 
 What?! Im Chandler!  Oh, thats Richard! |6| Oh my God, Richard.  
 Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you fell in love with! _B_ |3| No, I know. But yknow what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me. 
 Maybe, isnt she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud? |4|  Hey Chandler, do we know that lady? 
 Im full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, Ill regret it. |8|  Oh my God! That is so good! 
 Because uh we-we we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me. |1| So why cant the three of us go out together? 
 But what did he mean by rules? |1| Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone. 
 Is it made of cheese? |3| Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, Ive got a great little villa you can stay at. 
 I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic. |7| Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part? 
 I personally could have a gallon of Alan. _B_ |8| Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore. 
 Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife. |8| Thanks.....  
 You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer? |2| I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you? 
 Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls.  |3| What's going on? 
 Ooh, not so tight...  I'm sorry, just give me one more chance. |1|  Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you.  
 Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!  _B_ |9| Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.  
 Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.  |3|  It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied. 
 _B_ Hey! |8| Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it. _B_ 
 _B_ All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people. _B_ _B_ |5| Ok. _B_ 
 Could you get us a couple of beers? _B_ DR. |8| What's this. 
 No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them.  Hello sweet pants! |7| Does it hurt? 
 The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away. |0| Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!  
 Yes, yes, we had the sex. |3|  So, did you do it? 
 Ooh, let me talk to him! |9| Hello.  Oh, hey Ross! 
 Ah sure. What's in 'em? |4| Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party? 
 Hi! |9| Well, I was gonna let you play with it. _B_ 
 Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have? |6| All right. 
 So is your apron. Youre wearing it like a cape. |4| Its kind of embarrassing, yknow. I mean, I was an actor and now Im a waiter. Its supposed to go in the other direction. 
 Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?! |8|  My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I cant breathe. 
 Oh, its okay. I dont |3| No! No, she doesnt. Uh Phoebe, what she makesthats uhtheyre sock rabbits. They are completely differentOkay! Okay! Okay! I didnt make it! Im sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that were supposed to make the presents! 
 Well, I have some. |5| How? I dont have any money. 
 Hey. |8| Hey baby.  
 Excellent! Yknow Ross met somebody too! |9| Two days ago. 
 What? |4| No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batmans tux! 
 No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry,  it's about you and me and the fact that we're  best buds. |5| Get out. 
 Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please? |3|  What? Whoo... What? 
 I feel so bad. Is there, is there anything I can do to make it up to you? |1| I dont know what to say. We shouldnt have lied to you. 
 I'm serious! |2| Okay. 
 Hey! |8| Hey! 
 Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one? |2| Chandler, you're panicking! 
 Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one? |2| Chandler, you're panicking! 
 Is it |5| Yes, I am. 
 Nice work my friend. |8| Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line,  you know that's bad for the paper tray. 
 Why? |4| Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers. 
 Oh my God!  |4| Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to...  
 Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room. |4| Well you sure used a large font. 
 Veronica. Look, its got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat. |6| We didnt fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha! 
 And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave. |4| Shes going in. Wait! Hes going in! Hes going in!! The doors closed! I, I cant see anything but the door closed!! 
  Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend. |7| Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia. 
 Well, I just thought itd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend. |5| Why? 
 Okay, fine, $300. |2| Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half. 
 I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry. |0| I can't believe you let George Michael slap you. 
  What about the birds? |5| So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course! 
 Okay, bye!  |6|  Hey roomie! 
 Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad. |1| Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight. 
 What about all that friends forever stuff? |3| How was I supposed to know wed end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister? 
 What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!! |1|  Awww, man! He promised he wouldnt take the chairs!! 
 Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads. |6| No! No! Its just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad. 
 I dont want him to tell this story for years. |6| Listen, Im sure that dad doesnt care. He probably thought this was funny; hell be telling this story for years! 
 Okay. |5| Anyway, I started working on what Im going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it? 
 Yknow what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya? |2| Good God Bing I well I cant say Im altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at me, pure lust. 
 Because he was looking at her differently. |4| Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in! 
 Dont go! Im sorry. Im so sorry!  Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!  Or, call an ambulance. _B_ |0| You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didnt take any of my suggestions! Thats for coming buddy. Ill see you later.  
 Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing |9| Oh I’m kinda part of this. 
 Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression. |6| No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired. 
 Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing! |5| I proposed to Chandler!  Alright, moving on... 
 Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike. |9| No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults. 
 No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard. |1| Oh, okay.  _B_ 
 Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast. |3| Who is being loud? 
 Okay, now lets decide who has the nicest ass. |7| Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous. 
 About what? |4| Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna? 
 No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me? |1| The balloon? 
 It was fine, yknow? But she didnt agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, Im all right with it." |5| Uh-oh, it was bad? 
 Well, can I just |4| Oh-oh, my God! 
 Ahh yes, the messers become the messies! _B_ |8| Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So 
 Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water. |0| Umm, cups. 
 Yes I did, and I think you should do it. |8| Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing? 
  Hey! |8| Damn! 
 Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars! |7| A two and a five. 
  Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.  Commercial Break _B_ |2| No-no, its not okay! Its not! I mean you were just Youre so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Yknow Im just gonnaI, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there!  
 Hey-hey, hey!  I dont know why I did that! |7|  Monica! Chandler! 
 Well, close to  |4| How much? 
 Oh yeah? |6| I made you a surprise. 
 Yeah, thats her. The |5|  Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me! Joey and 
 You cant wear that! Im wearing the famous tux! James Bonds tux! |9| Thats right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film that Batman film he was in. 
  Oh come on!  Are you listening to this? |1| Id move in tomorrow! 
 That's what they'll call us. _B_ _B_ |2| Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies. 
 Why am I hearing cheering? |8| All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame...  
 Im sorry. Thats the one thing I cant do. I promised that Id be with Monica. |3| You could go to the game with me, even though I know you said you couldnt, but then you lied to me, tricked me and gave me a bump on the head. 
 Merry Christmas. |6| Okay! 
 Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things. |8| Thank you? 
 Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream. |5|  Okay, André should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye.  Just easier that way. 
 Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing. |1| You guys ready to go? 
 I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't. _B_ |2| Oh! 
 Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody. |6| We can't split them up! 
 Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody. |6| We can't split them up! 
 Congratulations. |9| Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.  
 Daaahhhh! |6| I used to be Bryce on All My Children. _B_ _B_ 
 Something else I might have said? |3| Hey-hey-hey thats funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?! 
 Look, when Ive been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and Im sorry. |2| That was me. 
 No, actually Lauries a boy. |4| But Jos got a crush on Laurie.  Oh. You mean its like a girl-girl thing? Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining. 
 Stop what?! |6| Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it! 
 Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? Hes not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys thats like a third or fourth date kinda thing. |2| Would you stop? Weve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we dont even know if hes gonna propose. 
 Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.  |9| Well, youre amazing. 
 All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, its over. |5| Then you go to Tokyo. 
 Okay! |7| Okay! 
 Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room! |6| 300 dollars?! 
 You pick one. |7| I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something." 
 No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there. |2| It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early. 
 Thats funny, I saw no phlegm. Commercial Break _B_ |2| Bye.  
 Her ankle is what youre watching? |1| Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle? 
 Wow!  You are way to young to have seen that! |8|  Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.  Commercial Break _B_ 
 So--You got in voluntarily?! |7| Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didnt think big enough to fit a grown man! 
 Yeah? |7| Hey Chandler? 
 Hi! Howd it go? |7|  Hey. 
 Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?  |2| Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand. 
 Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch. _B_ |2| Bing my boy, were gonna get you over this. Now heres the plan, grab your coat, were going to a strip club. 
 My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London! |6| And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules! 
 What are you doin? |7| No, they look too weird.  
 Ok.  |5| No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow. 
 WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!  |8| What's going on? 
 No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish. |1| G-gift? The thing's not the gift? 
 Morning. |7| Eddie. 
 You mean there's more than one of us. |2|  Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis. 
 Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..  |5| Oh, you got the whole night, huh? 
 Ill make something up! Im good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman! |3| When she sees that youre gone, shes gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and Im gonna get fired! 
 Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen? |0| I can't, I gotta go. 
 Shes shhing me! Its my phone and shes shhing me! |0|  Shh!!  Wait, what? 
 Okay.  |5| Yknow it doesnt matter how much Im craving it. Yknow why Im never gonna eat meat? Because its murder, cold blooded murder. 
  Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?  |5|  I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours. 
 He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady. |9| What?! 
 Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?   |5| Hey! You ready to go? 
 Hey, Kicky. What're you doing? |1| I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room! _B_ 
 Oh yeah! Okay, lets play again.  What do you got? |7| Really?! 
 Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me! |4| Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you  were trying to get Ross stoned! 
 Did you not understand the story? |3| Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story Ive had such a craving for them. 
 What are you doing tonight? |8| Oh its umm, its tofu cake. Do you want some?  
  Should we call the spitter? Commercial Break _B_ |4| Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so  "We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share."  Eh?  "It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving."  "We too can share and love and have and receive." 
 SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special. |5| So? 
 What do we do? |3| Im so sorry. 
 Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux? |8| Okay what’s up 
 Football? Just football? |5| Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game. 
 Merry Christmas, you guys! |8| Merry Christmas. 
 No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form. |6| Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad? 
 Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy? |0| No, forget it. 
 I think we've found our sperm! |0| Ok.  
 You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it? |2| Dude! You're not taking your Bible? 
 What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king? |4| Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible? 
 What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king? |4| Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible? 
 You couldn't have told me about this on the phone? |1| Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry. 
 Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching. |1| Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh! 
 No!! You cant!! |2| I dont know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. Ill go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!  
 I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person.  No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler! |1| Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her! 
 Well, yknow Im 29. I mean who needs a savings account. |4|  A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff? 
 Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, yknow, I know where everything goes, its always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebodys killing her in there!" |6| Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree  like that. 
 I majored in lightning rounds. All right, were gonna destroy you. |4| You guys are dead, I am so good at lighting rounds. 
 Theres a Phoebe on my sandwich!  |0| Okay.  
 What? |4| It is not over! Youre over! 
 Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining! |4| All right, how about the ladybugs? 
 Y'know I rued the day once didn't get a whole lot else done. |7| Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice. 
 What? |4| Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?   
 It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon!  She's-she's gonna kill me. |9| Well, are you just hanging out with Ross? 
 Then why-why is she going to a play?! |2| No-no, she really is sick! 
 Shes just doing her job! |6| Well its hard to tell  Oh God, if she would just stop moving. 
 You are totally and completely 100% forgiven. |4| Oops!  Yknow, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too? 
 BEND OVER?!!! _B_ |4| I was tryin to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what Im gonna do? 
 Im a little busy here Paul. |9| Would you .Would you hug me? 
 Yes, you can pass for 19. |6| You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?! 
 Yknow what would work? |2|  Its unbelievable! I-I cant believe that sign didnt work! 
  Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Rosss situation? |4| Oh great! Were going out again Saturday. But I just found shes also seeing some other guy. 
 Marcel? |1| Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry. _B_ 
 Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could .  |6| Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit em. I cant wait. Theyre going to be crying so hard. Theyre going to be fighting for breath. 
 Look, I can't do this. I can't make luv to you while we'refighting this way. |7| Spend more time with the tie. That'll make a baby. 
 No...if crazy plate lady..._B_ If Monica dies...then...I would get Emma...right? |0| Ok, how bout this. If you guys die, and the crazy plate lady dies...THEN do I get the baby. 
 _B_ What? |4| You can go.

 Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!  |9| You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence? 
 And yet I never run into Beyonce! |9| What a small world! 
 Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years. |7| I don't think so. 
 That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales. |6| Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is. 
 Oh it's uh, over there on the table. |5| Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. _B_ Where's the mail? 
 No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?  |5| Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment? 
 Hey. |8| Hey! 
 At least let me smoke it to the good part. _B_ |4| Chandler!! 
  Theyll never understand! |7|  No! Joey, we swore wed never tell! 
 Oh-ho-ho, I dont think so!  |4| No, theres nothing to make up, shes gonna know that I have a key to her office, Ive got to get you locked up back the way you were!  
 Im sorry.  If you ask me, I'd move in with him. |2| You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God! 
 Well, you're gonna. |6| Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear. 
 Youre kidding right? |8| A four and a nine. 
 The reason we havent told them were together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this? |0| Ross, I cant believe youd do that! 
 Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess. |2| BEND OVER?!!! _B_ 
 Hey! Whats up? |8|  Hey! 
 Dude! Dude!  |9| Huh? Uh  
 Okay, open ours next. Open ours next! |0| No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.  
 Please, dont take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?! |4| Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.  
 Sure, whats up? |4| Hey Toby, you got a sec? 
 You dont say anything. |3| Just a minute!  Thats Mrs. Tribbiani! 
 Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma? |6| Oh yeah . 
 It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer...  What the...  What are you doing? |6| Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing. 
 Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger. |4| Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok. 
 Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him? |3| Does seem pretty perfect. 
 Where are Bill and Colleen? |4| Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for. Frank Jr.  Look at them! Aw. I love you so much.  Oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up! _B_ 
 Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie. |9| Is he alright out there by himself? 
 And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you. |9| Thank you for letting us see the house again. 
 Monica, we are not ready to have two babies! |6| Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt. 
 Monica, we are not ready to have two babies! |6| Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt. 
  Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus.  Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid character. |3| Oh. Mine does.  Stephanie knows all the chords.  _B_ 
 Isn't Ben in this? |0| I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? _B_ 
 Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you? |9| Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds. 
 Uuuh. _B_ |6| I wa- 
 You-you-you dont wanna give into the fear. |7| No, its not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I dont have a lead. Okay, y'know what, Im just gonna, Im just gonna call Gunther and Im gonna tell him, Im not quitting. 
 You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection.  'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself. _B_ |0|  Yeah? _B_ 
 I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!  You are surprisingly strong! |8| Look, they must be stopped! 
 Well, this is much better. _B_ The |4| Oh-ho-ho, I dont think so!  
 Oh, I dont know. |4| Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had. 
 Look, you dont have to draw an actual wowhoa! Shes hot! |4| All right, Im gonna show you something a lot of guys dont know. Rach, give me that pad, please?  All right. Now 
 Well, Im so confused as to what weve been doing so far |2| Huh, wanna bet? 
 Okay.  Good one. |5| You know! 
 We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story! |9| Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story! 
  Yes, he is! |9| No he's not! 
 Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!  _B_ |1| Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds! 
 Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly!  |2| Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness! 
 We should start with the big stuff. Yknow? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch.  I got it.  |4| Yeah, the phone was facing the other way.  And that goes back up there. Commercial Break _B_ 
 Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? Im going to go over to Joeys. |2| Now are drawers will smell nice and we didnt waste these pantyhose. 
 I think its great that you work here. Youre going to make a lot of money, and heres your first |4| See, now its weird again. 
 Yeah!  |8| We have got to wash that!  
 ....with' |4| ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...  
 Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out.  Oh hey! There you go.  Okay.  |6| Thats exactly what my dad used to say!  
  And uh, you dont have a mustache which is good.  Im Chandler; I make jokes when Im uncomfortable. Richards |2| Well, my nose got lonely. 
 Yes! |8| Really? 
 If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off! |1| You were trying to eat it!  
 Stop making candy! |6| Hmm? 
 Yeah, were gonna need to see that tape.  |5|  So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. _B_ It kept rolling and recorded everything.  
 Oh! Hi! |9| Hey Mona! 
 Marcel? |1| Marcel? 
 That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I'm notgonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to beconceived? |1| Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity. But when you wantedto have sex right after my uncle's funeral 
 Actually what? |3| Well, actually.... 
 Really? Are you going to be okay? |0| You should go to the game. Its okay, I want you to. 
  The wife says "Hi!". |1|  Blah blargah, blar-blab.  _B_ 
 It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else. |0| Why not? 
 That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic. |0| You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news. 
 No, Eddie likes to keep it over there. |6| You don't keep it over here on this table any more? 
 Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math. |6| What the hells the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey. 
 Oh, so youre going with the teacher, huh? |6| All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince. 
 Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes? |7| I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls... 
 Well thats a full cup!  |7| No. Why? 
 I always thought having a heart attack was natures way of telling you to die!  But youre not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but youre not gonna die today. I wish I was dead. |1| Honey, having a heart attack is natures way of telling you to slow it down. 
 ...And what did you bring? |6| Hi, Joey.  Well well, look what you brought. 
 Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 900. |1| Oh!  Sorry. Uh, Ive got those plans with Phoebe, why? 
 So this is nice! I wish I didnt have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to.  Oh uh, by the way, whats the name of the girl youre dating? Joey and |2| Well you shouldnt be. Believe me I wouldnt want to be the guy whos up against you.  I mean that doofus is going to lose! 
 Look, its my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you. |1| Pretty please? Not very uh, 007. 
 Im not going to let you say anything. |2| Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies? 
 People who’ve never ever been to Paris. |5| What? Who says that? 
 I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.  |2| Okay... 
 Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway! |5|  No. 
 We have to leave!! |2| They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are? 
  You can't make this stuff up! _B_ |3| Bert and Ernie! 
  Don't, don't!  |0| Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! . So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie  
  Okay. Shhh...  |9| That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children! 
  Okay. Shhh...  |9| That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children! 
 Together. |6| All of us. 
 Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out. |4| Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons. 
 Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you. |2| Why?! How?! How is he a genius? 
 You mean a three pointer? |4| Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer. 
 Look man! |7| I need juice! People need juice!! 
  We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didnt think we could make it.  |6|  All right!! All right.  I got stung. Stung bad. I couldnt stand. I-I couldnt walk. 
 Thank you, Joey. |9| Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when Im doing something exciting and I dont wanna get too excited, I just ahh, yknow try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler! 
 You mean with Casey. |6| Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Im gonna do that. 
  There are seven?! |8| Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones.  You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven! 
 Steps!  Slut!  You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy! |7| Oh, are we gonna trash that place?  
 I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww! |0| What?! 
  If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon? Grandma |8|  Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault. 
 Hey Gar! |1| Hey Chandler. 
 Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite? |1| Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind! 
 Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love. |7|  Okay-okay! Two very good points, look Ive known you both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness? 
 Hey, will you grab me a cruller?  Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?! |2|  Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year. _B_ 
 What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table. |5| Yeah that-that, doesn't look right. 
 Yes, but I feel like Ive really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think were two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple. |5| Wait, were supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer. 
 Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?! |1| Well uh, she didnt want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. Im so sorry. 
 Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts.  Chan and Jan Forever. |4| I brought you something. 
 You have done enough! |5| Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive? 
 Okay!  |7| Five more seconds. 
 Hi. |8| Hi, Im Lisa. 
 Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31! |6| Seriously? 
 Well, youre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding? Rachel and |2|  Ohh, you guys are so made for each other. 
  All right, Im off to see your dad. |6|  Come on.  Hello?  Im sorry you have the wrong number.   Okay, Ill call you later dad. I love you.  _B_ 
 Huh. |5| Oh, nothin much. Just trying to figure out what Im gonna do for dinner. 
 You mean they like you. |5| But they like it! 
 For my last birthday you gave me a hug!  Okay, read the card! Read the card! |2| Now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you guys? 
 Joeys gonna be thrilled! He was hoping youd come by as a slutty nurse. |4| Hi! 
 Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something... |3| Marcel?  Woman No. 1 Hi, can I help you?  
  The sunll come out tomorrow! Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow  therell be sun. |0| All right.  _B_ 
 Mean it? |7| No, you're right. Mnya, we shouldn't do it like this. Huch.For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down onyou so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not theend of the world. 
 What'! |5| Er...it's just that in THAT case...then erm...Emma would go to my parents. 
 Youre gonna put sweats on and clean, arent ya? |9| Yeah, itll be fine. Yknow, maybe Ill stay and practice the art of seduction. 
 Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen. |1| Ah. Fun conversation? 
 You have gotta stop! |4| God works in mysterious ways. 
 Okay. |5|  Okay. Shhh...  
 Okay. |5|  Okay. Shhh...  
 Oh, ooh. |7| Alright, here you go my friend. Eggs a-la Eddie, huh? 
 Hey! Well, Ive been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you thats mean! |8| All right, thats it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself. 
 Run, Joey! Run for your life!  |8|  Hey! I got great news! 
 Hey. |8|  Hi! 
 Really?! |5|  We were just talking about you. 
 Say 200? |4| 150 dollars. 
 Ow! |2| Theyre in Vermont!! How could this happen?!  
 Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave? |6| Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking... 
 Hey! |8| Hey! 
 Janice?  |9| She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice. 
 It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together. |5| You're not going to believe this! 
 Thats what Monica said. |6| What?! Tonight?! 
 Bye!  Commercial Break _B_ |6| Kristen Lang. 
 That was pretty 007. _B_ |4| When I got married you slept with my sister. 
 Oh, God!  |3| You just stay here!  
 We’re moving to Tulsa!  |7| What’s going on? 
 Yeah, he's better! |4| No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you. 
 I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him. |1| Why? What did you do in the bathroom? 
 What? |4| Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus. 
  Why!? |2| No, actually, we're buying the house next door.  
 You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT! |5| What? 
 Why cant we talk in here? With, with, witnesses. |3| Come on!!  
 Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits. |2| What am I going to do? 
 Listen to me!!  |7| People need juice! 
 Or Casey. |5| No-no-no, I think Im gonna see how things go with Kathy. Shes pretty cool. 
  Sounds like a really bad idea to me. |1| Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew! 
  Thats one? |5| Let me see that.  Oh, yeah. 
 That was amazing! |9| I forgot my paper.  _B_ 
 I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot? |2| Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room. 
 Thats laughter. |8| Love is the best medicine. 
 I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and lets just get that thing pushed back in. |0| Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides its getting darker and more painful, that means its healing. 
 OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch. |5| Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet. 
 Nah, Nah, its okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing. |1| You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. Youre right, Im sorry. 
 Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out. |1| I had them made special. 
 Hey!  |8| Hey sweetie! 
 No you dontget it in black, not brown.  |7| I wanna wake up early and go get it for you! 
 Janice?! |7| Janice?  
 Richard! No one supposed to know about us!  See I, did it again. |0| Oh, Im sorry.  Lisa,  Monica, Chandler. We used to date. 
 Well, come on, Ive been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party. |5| Ah, yeah! 
 No!  Shhh! |0|  HeyOoh! Whats-whats that, dinner stuff? You making dinner? 
 Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you? |8| Maybe. 
 No-no-no-no! That was the joke! |0| Okay.  Happy birthday Grandma! Its better to be over the hill  then buried under it.  All our love Monica and Chandler.  Thats funny, yeah! 
 Youd think that would embarrass me, but you see Im maxed out. |2| Umm, actually Im just a nurse. 
 Yes have you seen any? Woman No. 1 No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators? |4| A monkey. 
 I think youll find if I come to work here, I dont micro-manage. I dont shy away from delegating. |7| Thats right. _B_ 
 You are incredible. Unless, I...I'm not gonna smoke again.And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you.  |4| Yah. 
 This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.  _B_ |2| Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible?  
 Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?  |3| Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that? 
 She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica. |9| But she liked us. 
 Okay! |7| Okay! 
 Okay! |7| Okay! 
 What? |4| Huh. 
 Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car. |0| Oh, can I borrow this?  My milks gone bad. 
 And then Joey remembered something. |9| And I was tired from digging the huge hole! 
  Right in there! _B_ |7| Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet. 
 I confronted her, and she didnt deny it!  I dont live here!  |8| So you were right? 
 Maybe, she doesnt hit him all the time. _B_ |3| Howhow did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!  
 Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again. |2| Hey! 
  It was a car backfire! |2| My God, Joey! 
 No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married." |8| No. 
 So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?! |2|  What?!!  What? 
 Again? |5| Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again. 
 Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to faceAnd by face I dont mean his lap. And by face, I dont mean my ass.  |1|  Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time. 
 Look, we can’t stay in here forever. |3| Well I didn’t! I didn’t propose!  Unless uh…  Did I? I haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something I would do. Commercial Break _B_ 
 Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes. |5| Excuse me? 
 So, if Monica's not around, I'm not good enough to raise Emma? |0| Er... Who has to die for me to get her? _B_ 
 Thanks. Listen, Im never gonna lie to you again. |8| Thanks, heres ya ticket. 
 Whoa-ho, back off, Missy!  |0| This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.  _B_ 
 Really? Are you sure? |6| No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else. 
 Uh-huh. |2| You, you want, you want me to move out? 
 _B_ Hey, big guy, game time. |9| Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity. 
 All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.' |3| I don't know you guys. 
 Shes moving on! Okay, if its not this guy, its gonna be somebody else! And unless youre thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? Its over. |1| Juice, I need... 
 99...100! Ready or not, here I come!  All right, let's go over the concept one more time. |5|  Right in there! _B_ 
 Could be Casey. |4| No-no, Kathy. 
 Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players. |7| No! I balanced my checkbook. 
  Oh, yknow, yknow what Pheebs? |9|  Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry 
 Oh, yknow-yknow what, I was looking at it upside down. |3| Its kind of an important one! 
 That was amazing. |9| Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner. 
 So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money? |0| Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket. 
 Oh my God. |4| For 99 cents, I'd eat you.  Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look!  Oh! Look! Hi! 
 I dont know. |5| Why do you do it? 
 Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!! |2| Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area. 
 You know when guys hang out they dont just drink some beer and hammer up drywall? |1| Yeah. Go over to Joeys. Go over to Joeys and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall. 
  It is? |4| That's fine. 
 Theres no back to this couch! |0|  Chicken Soup for the Soul? 
 Oop!  |8| Oop, your cake is ready! 
 Joey's tailor...took advantage of me. |9| Oh.... my.... God. _B_ 
 Do you have my credit card? |2| Whoa-whoa-hey-hey!  Hi, Paul is it?  
 Yeah, Ill sit down.  |7| Chandler, wh-why dont we sit down? 
 No, because youre not a grandmother! |4|  No, I know! I get it! Its funny! 
  What I do do is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me. |6| Um-hmm, thats good to know. But lets stop focusing on what you dont do, and start focusing on what you do do. 
 Yeah, let's celebrate life! |9| D'you want to? 
 ...He's in. |0| We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing... 
 Your Veal Chop is $34.95! |2| Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.  
 This can not be happening! |3| Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it!  Ellen, we're going to talk numbers.  
 Howdy. |7|  Gimme the bottle.  Gimme the towel.  _B_ 
 Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good. |8| No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me. 
 Great. It was great. Shes ah, shes great, great looking, great personality, shes greatness. |9| So umm, how was your date with Ginger? 
  Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?! Commercial Break _B_ |8|  Sure. Ill help you. 
 Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn. |1| Well, so, why dont you just turn it off? 
 Yeah. I really do. |4| You really think so? 
 Hey. |8| Hey! 
 And I am not blah, I am a hoot! |7| Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her! 
 Well, its like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.  Joey's Look-A-|0| Oop!  
 Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?  |2| Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didnt want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that shes going to Florida for spring vacation. 
  Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?  Yeah, I miss you too.  Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know?  Well, that's very generous  er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about....  And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier?  Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection!  No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy!  I'll see you on Monday!  _B_ |1| And again, and again, and again...  Hello?  And again. 
 No, I realize that honey, but Im not gonna spend all of the money on one party. |2| This is the most special day of our lives. 
 Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu. |5| Oh. Then, no.  Woman No. 2 Did I put too much rum in here?  Woman No. 1 Just a sec.  Hope you find your monkey.  
 Im not crazy about babies. Im crazy about us. |6| What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies? 
 This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.  |0| Oh, I still can’t believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn’t make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees! 
 The Sooner State, whatever that is. |0|  Tulsa, Oklahoma! 
 And I want you to know that no-one thinks that you are stupid. |2| Okay. 
 I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ...  Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma? |1|  ...Missy? 
  Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm. |0| Yeah, I'm sure. 
 This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue. |5| I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think? 
 What, like a number? |2| Its beautiful! Its like the first bathroom floor there ever was.  Whoa! Are you going in there for? 
 He paints quite a picture doesn't he? _B_ |6| And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!' 
 Okay. |5| Yeah, okay. 
 Hey! |8|  Hey! 
 Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit. |2| All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig!  Oink! _B_ 
 Consider Casey. |5| No. No, Kathy. 
 Im not Jewish, so |4| What? 
 Fine, lets do it. |8| You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say? 
 No, you're the best. |2| We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best. 
 Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.  |6| No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One. 
 Yeah, I do. |6| Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right? 
 Oh no, you see, actually it is. |2| Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end. 
 Yeah I know, but I figured a shot yknow? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldnt think I was yknow, all dead inside. |2| Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff. 
 Well? |6|  Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?  Yeah, I miss you too.  Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know?  Well, that's very generous  er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about....  And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier?  Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection!  No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy!  I'll see you on Monday!  _B_ 
 Thank God!  |8| Yes, its in my In in my pocket.   My back pocket! My back pocket! 
  Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!! |0| Bye Chandler!   I miss you already.  
 You see, I dont say _B_ |5| Are you saying that you dont want to get with this? 
 That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie. |3| Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it. 
 Hardest thing Ive ever done in my life. |4| I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way. 
 What...what is wrong with me? Am I, am I incompetent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you! |1| Yeah! He's lying he looked down!  
 But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?  |0| I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet. 
 But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this? |6| C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now. 
 The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers. |3| Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will. 
 Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed. |3|  Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre. 
 So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh? Commercial Break _B_ |1| Yeah.  
 That's me. |9| He's here.  I'm assuming one of you is the father. 
 See ya. _B_ |6| Well you guys, I'm outta here. See ya pals. 
 Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel. |5| There's a game? 
 Joey told you about the leg, huh? |5| Sounds like shes got the ah, whole package. 
 Oh-no, yknow with Gandolf wed be out all night! |4| So what if he didnt come! We can still go out and party ourselves! 
 That-thats bad? |4|  Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp. 
 Uh, Ross? |4| Stop saying that. I hate that. _B_ 
 Love your condoms my man. |8| Hi! 
 Get off! _B_ |3| Thanks, Chandler.  
 But you found the keys to his clothes? |5|  So the Porsche guy took his car back. 
 No thanks, Josephine. _B_ |9| Hey Chandler. Come on in. Were knitting pot holders. 
 No, you shNo you said you made that up!! |6| I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, dont-dont be mad. Im sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Yknow? And it was our first date! Plus, shes really sick! 
 Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite... |0| No way! I've been going to the guy for 12 years. 
 Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no. |2| Honey, umm I-I love you,  but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay?  Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, were only gonna get married once. 
 Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, its going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! Were not even sure why were having it. |1| I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why dont you tell about your lovely wedding? 
 Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot. |7| Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here? 
 Sure, why dont you set it up. Ill just be over here, browsing through the personals. |5| Id like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldnt that be nice? 
 Look, weve always talked about having babies someday. Im not saying it has to be right now, but Im starting to think that we can handle it. Were good. Were really good. |6| What? 
 Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning! Surrey With A Fringe On Top. |8| Chandler, I don’t even wanna see the musical Oklahoma! 
 Games tomorrow night, Joe. _B_ _B_ _B_ Rachel, |8| Thanks, man. _B_ Where ya going? 
  No,... no...  NO!  Look, I'm, I'm married! |0| You are to me...  
 So you know this leaves us with... |5| That is so sweet. I love you.  
  She? It's a girl? |1| Here she comes! 
  She? It's a girl? |1| Here she comes! 
 Gee, Monica, what's in the bag? |0| So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh? Commercial Break _B_ 
 You want some help. |2| Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. _B_ But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack! 
 Hi! Bye!  |9|  Hey! 
 I know.  _B_ |5| Its just I miss her so much. 
 Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate. |2| Hey guys.  Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight? 
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy."  Can you give me a hand with all this stuff? |6| Any luck? 
 That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place! _B_ |7| Yknow what I think? I think somebodys got a little crush on Casey. How bout I fix you two up? What do you think? 
 Bad dream? |1| So! Ross doesnt really decorate his tree with floss, but you dont hear him complaining do you? God!  
 Yknow you, really didnt have to take me to the airport. |3| Wow! If only more people knew. _B_ 
 Oh my God. |4| Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!  _B_ 
 No, you're the best. |2| No, you're the best. 
 Who jumps at loud noises! |2| Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you. 
 Look, Im just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff. |1| God, its gonna so weird like when I come home and youre not here. Yknow? No more Joey and Chans. No more J and Cs. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandlers?" "Cant, its not there." 
 Oh Joeys got a really bad hernia, but thats nothing a little laser eye surgery wont fix! |1| Whats going on? 
 Hey Ross, I was wondering if Oh my God!! Where are all the men'? _B_ |3| No thanks, Josephine. _B_ 
 Oh, no I don't. |1| No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing. 
 Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest. |4| Oh thats so sweet! Look Chandler I dont care if you cant cry, I love you. 
 Look at this!  |6|  Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube. 
 Oh, I cant go. |5| Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight. 
 Yes.  Matire'|0| Oh. Good to see you guys. 
 Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me? |1| Actually, I did! 
  Whoa! Shes purty! |5|  Oh, sweet Jesus! Oh! Monica, these are the  cookies they serve in hell! _B_ 
 Oh!  |7| You gotta go! 
 I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn’t for fun. |6| Of course. I’ll always be your dad. 
 See? Intuitive! |1| I'm adopted?! 
 I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar! |0| Joey and Rachel's apartment. Chandler and Rachel are talking.] 
 I know.. |4|  Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us. 
 That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!? |0|  Okay, Okay,  All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house. 
 At least as long as I have the pants.  |4| How long do you want the cuffs? 
  What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you. |1| Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it.  You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day. 
 Actually, uh, we're both the father.  _B_ Chandler and |7| I'm him. 
 Oh, I couldn't be happier. |4| So how you two gettin' along? 
 Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldnt have, but it did. I mean I like her, I dont want to stop seeing her, but every so often its like Hey, y'know what, wheres your leg? I mean Im the smallest person in the world arent I? Im the smallest person in the world. |4| Uh-huh. 
 The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts! |6| Chandler? 
 Well you might if it were anything like 7! |7| Well if you go to Disneyland, you dont spend the whole day on the Materhorn. 
 Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julies |7| Are you sure? 
 Okay, Im going to go stand over there.  |2| I dont get this! She was horrible!  
 Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings? |1| Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."  _B_ 
  Well I mean, let me get the door first.  Oh, hi! No one.  |6| What? Chandler! Tell 'em! 
 Well you did pull his hair. |5| That kid really kicked me hard on the plane. 
 Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine? |7| Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue. 
 Eh, theyre both good. I generally just go with, Monicas drunk again.  |4| I know, but dont you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing? 
 Cupping. |5| What? 
 Yes, I am! |7| You-youre gonna have to put your foot down? 
 There has got to be a way! |6| Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy!  He brought Twizlers! Commercial Break _B_ 
 Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people. |1| We can't, alright?  We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.  
 90 seconds. |3| How long has it been this time? 
 Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough. |8| Are you okay? Youve been acting weird all afternoon. 
 But nothing has to happen until your ready. |1| We are pretty good. 
 No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus.  I’ll get out of it. |2| Are you trying to tell me that we’re moving to Oklahoma, or that you’re gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise? 
 I'm *happily* married. |8| So? I'm married.  
 There you go! Someone came! |5| It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!  
 How do you feel about that? |5| Adoption. 
 Hey!... aaaaaahhhh! |9| Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!  
 When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it? |1|  Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner! 
  Well, now we have one of each!  And that's enough! _B_ |8| Yeah. 
  Well, now we have one of each!  And that's enough! _B_ |8| Yeah. 
 Its gotta be the first one. |4| Why dont you ask Chandler, cause hes the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin over Janice by groping my sister. 
 Im sorry, Im sorry, it just seems that Robert isnt as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped. |1| You guys!! Come on! 
 And thats the only colour that comes in. |9| I want you to met some friends of mine.  This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we dont do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say lets Ross it! 
 Off?!! |0| We were just waxing our legs. 
  Joey kept screaming at me, Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!! Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming. |7| Thats right I stepped up! Shes my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, Id pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldnt. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler. 
 Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week. |4| It's 430. 
 She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her. |2| All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen. 
 Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebes song about? |1| I wasnt sleeping. 
 Well, were really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then. |1| Oh please. Every moment is precious. Yknow? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving. 
 You remember Janice. |7| I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!  
 I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom? |0| You're my friend. I-I had to tell you. 
 Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.  |1| Wow! I could've died tonight. 
 Not once did we do that. |0| Yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future. 
 I did, but... |0| Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed? 
 No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, were up at the altar and Im like this.  |0| Stop it! 
 Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of... |9| Oh! You have a window! 
 Nancy Thompsons getting fired!  |5|  You told her! 
 Phoebe knows about us! |6| Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us! _B_ 
  Marry her. _B_ |5| Yes! 
 Really? |5| Okay, dont worry. Youre ready. 
  Why? Why-why-would you—Wh-why…  Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want. Mr. |1| It wasn’t fun?! 
 What did I just say?  |3| But you are a liar. 
 oh, honey.. |2| I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us? 
 Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out. |8| Okay, you come up with an idea. 
  All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run? |3| I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best.  I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese. 
 Please tell me you know which one is our baby. |6| Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy! 
 She's one of us now. _B_ |7| You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH. 
 There's another carton right over there. |7| Great, well, I'm happy for ya. _B_ Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice. 
 Before!! |5| After!! 
  Actually hes the smallest person in the world. |8|  Morning. 
 Yes! See you and I have always been like _B_ |9| Beefsteak Charlies? 
 Pregnant Woman Slays Four? |3| Oh this, well Im glad you asked.  Now, dont you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?  Ahh! Now, I know what youre thinking 
 Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first |8| Yeah! Here!  Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay. 
 All right, bye-bye now! |2| All right!  
 Im not getting into this again! |8| He took my snack! 
 That is true. |9| Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnt have the car! Right? 
 Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that. |2| Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh" 
 Who the hell is Carl?! |9| Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl. 
 I can see it now, "Look dad, its the Sphinx!"  |7| I went to Egypt with my dad. 
 Oh, thats uh, thats pretty nice but Im gonna go with the one I picked first. |3| Chandler, I found the perfect ring.  
 I still dont get it, we didnt do anything wrong. |2| Regina Philange.  
 Yeah.  Oh no wait, Im not an nine-year-old girl. |0| Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin? 
 Marcel?! _B_ |7| Marcel? 
 You know, it haunts me? Up til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver! |0| Thats better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it except all I did was think about it. 
 Im sorry, did you say cheese? |1| Jeez! What is with you? 
 What?! Its not right! Were not ready to have a kid now!! |3| Well maybe Im ready now. I mean, its a little scary, but maybe its right. 
  What is wrong with Emma? |4| Thank you. 
 Look, I may not know alot about babies, but you really think I'm not capable? |2| No, you're all about the fun.  
 Right. So, I'm sorry... |0| Oh. What's *that* like? 
 Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way. |4| I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it. 
 I think.... I think I can see your scalp. |6| What do you think? 
 Which technically now you should give back! |6| He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell. 
 And that's how you bought it? |4| Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU.  Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday? 
 God, I love these fingers... |8| I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask... _B_ 
 Yep, Im in a tree. _B_ |5| Really? Thats great! You and my sister, sittin in a tree. 
 Yeah, well I dont think you can make that statement, unless youve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely. |4| For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience. 
 You-you do? |8| Okay, I see what's going on here. 
 Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic? |2| Aw, honey, that's so sweet. 
 Okay. Then I guess its just, wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen. Ticket Counter |0| On no! No! Its not good-bye, Im not leaving until you get on that plane. 
 What? |4| Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh...  I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom. 
 Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.  |0|  God, your hair sure is different! 
 Hey. |8| Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots. _B_ 
  Oh my God!  |4| I do have a newfound respect for life. 
 Hey! |8|  Hi. 
 Okay.  |5| Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner. 
 Call me! _B_ |5| You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.  
 Yeah? |7| I wont care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.  
  Hey. |8| Joey that is so sweet.  
  OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down. |5| Oh look! That guy's peeing! 
 I cant help it! |9| See? Thats a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera.  Youre changing it! 
 Yknow, that party wasnt bad. |4| Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. Shes such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass. _B_ 
 Okay. _B_ The Cooking |7| Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and youll be great. 
 Uhh. You are welcome. |9| Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you. _B_ 
  Please, come in. |3| Hi, glad you could come. 
 Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something... |0| You still here? 
 Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to. |1|  Please.. please, we are so close. 
 Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and  "Oh My God"! |9| But we love our house. 
 You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie. |7| Yeah I guess you're right. 
 Ok. |5| Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks. 
 Alright, so what's it about? |2| Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man. 
  Hello, Janice. |9|  No, thank you.  Chandler! 
 It came up. |4|  Heard about the leg burnin huh? 
 So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner. |5| Oh!  
 Do either of you have the keys? |3| No, no, no, you said, "got the keys". 
 Hi! |9| Hi, Rach. 
 Yeah, we are so sorry. |0| Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk. 
 Why?! What happened?! |0| They uh director. Uhh, her.  All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here. 
 Well, I told you not to walk. Here.  There. Okay.  |3| Okay! Oh God, yknow what? Its really bad. 
 That's not specific to girls. |4| Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science. 
 Yknow sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, arent they? |6| Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project. 
 I cant believe I did this! What an idiot! |1| I said name one! Commercial Break _B_ 
 What? |4| Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. Its over! 
 Hey! |8|  Hey. Ross and 
  Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us? Woman At The |0| People have got to finish their stories! Commercial Break _B_ 
 I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke! |0| I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes. 
 I cant believe there is a naked hooker in there! |7| Im sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green. _B_ 
 Maybe Monica has a bobby pin. |6| Then why do you throw like one? 
 I can do that. |1| Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why dont we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed? 
 Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I dont believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I wont stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese. |8| All right, whats going on? 
 Im kidding. This is going to be fun. |4| What?!! 
 Umm ma’am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa. Ms. |2| Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa. _B_ 
 Ok, so if we both had Emma, and I die _B_ she'd have to give her up. |1| No...you both are equally capable. It's just that you're strongest, when you're together. 
 Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this |3| Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy? 
  Yeah. |6| So this is it, we're really gonna adopt? 
 I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real." |2| You told him he's adopted? 
 Oh, so that's what this is for. |5| Ooh, this is it, 74. _B_ 
 Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice. |3| Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.  
 No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are. |3| Thank you. 
 Yeah. |6| Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food? 
 So, you still dont think Im boyfriend material? |2| Cool! Ill catch up!  Commercial Break _B_ 
 You got me. |6| Yeah! You don't like Kathy. 
 So yknow, uh, whens he getting back? |2| Oh, yknow, would you just for once, not remember every little thing!!  
 Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket. Ticket Counter |0| One ticket to Yemen? 
 Thats a low one! |5| Okay.  Four. 
  You knew about this? |5| I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in- 
  You're naked in this picture! |5| Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.  
 Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.  |8|  Oh?  Hello you. 
 So, what do you think? |4| Paolo made a pass at me.  _B_ 
 Okay, well I wont uh, worry about this anymore then. |3| Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you dont cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it wont matter to me. 
 I couldnt do it. |8| Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday? 
 This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?  |9|  OK. 
 I had to okay?! Were getting married! Married couples cant keep secrets from one another! |5|  How could you tell her?! 
 Borrow money from me? |2| All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots? 
 Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights. |2| I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet? 
 I dont see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk? |2| Yeah! I didnt know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise! 
 What? |4| You know what? Let's not talk. 
 Emma was doing it! |9| What are you doing? 
 Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat. |6| Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class. 
 Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape? |2| Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying...  Stop lying! 
 So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us. |3|  okay, right.  
 If you win, we give up the birds. |3| Oooohh that’s interesting. 
  Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door.  Oh, that does it too.  _B_ r |2| Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.  
 All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker. _B_ |5| I'm gonna do it.  
 Yeah? |7| Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth. 
 Well I like both eggs equally. |9| Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh? 
  Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been? |9| What are you doing here? 
 Oh, thats mature. |6| Oh yeah, come here.  
 Where? |5|  Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you! 
 Air hole! Air hole!!  |3|   Now, well see. 
 Not even on page 7? |0| Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here. 
 No! |2| This doesnt mean anything, does it? 
 Oh yeah? Well, howd she take it? |7| So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us. 
 Yeah.  |6| Im gonna call her. 
 Do you think hell ever forgive me? |5| Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There arent any message youve forgotten to give me are there?  Apparently youre not very good at it! I 
 Thank you Helen, that'll be all.  |4| This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?  
 They put you in jail? |6| Some guy bought it. Im sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail! 
 Well maybe it was all of your questions. |4|  Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!  
 Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it.  Maam, are you also a stripper? |4| Wait! Wait! Maybe shes a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what shes supposed to do. 
 So, hows the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming? |1| Sure. "Monica." 
 Okay. Now all weve got to do is get rid of this chair.  |1| Okay.  
 No. But Im sure  tomatoes does. |5| Chandler, you dont believe in soul mates? 
 Treasure of the Sierra Madre! |9|  In what John Houston film would you hear this line, "Badges? We dont need no stinkin badges!" 
 Were trying to get pregnant.  Yknow Im not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying? |2| So were gonna try? I mean, are we trying? 
 It’s a funny story, actually.  I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really know what I was saying. Ms. |5| What? 
 We are gonna be great parents. |8|  Oh my God, we're gonna be parents! 
  By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall. |1| But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope? 
 Yeah. |6| Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh. 
 Your cappucino sir. |8| _B_ Hard to say. _B_ 
 Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..  |3|  Oh my God, I'm late.  
 What? |4| Well, now we got a reason. 
 I saw you checking me out during the game last night. |7| Huh? 
 Yeah. Right. |5| Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right? 
 Yknow, I knew something like this was going to happen.  |2| A couple of days. 
 What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with? Ticket Counter |1| Im sorry sir, I dont understand. 
 I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?! |0| Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing. 
 Oh my God! |4| Hi, Chandler. 
 Ross? |6| I know.  
 Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued. |3| Eh? 
 I know!  |5| I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen. 
 Okay! |7| I wanna say good-bye at the car! 
 Ahh, I think it just moved. Its really poking me. |3| Come on! What are you doing?! Im in character! Would you talk to her!  
 And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny. |2| Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar. 
 Aww, I love you so |8| And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And youre writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still cant shed one tiny tear, I know youll be crying a river inside. 
 Hey, relax I just need more time. Were going to dinner tonight. |8| You couldnt do it?! 
 Last time I do that, I promise. _B_ |3| Thank you Helen, that'll be all.  
 Du-ude! |6| Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City. 
 Why is there jelly on your shoe? |5| Okay, firstfirst of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up.  See? All right, now you try. Look down , youre looking down, keep looking down 
 Im just trying to find the right moment, you know? |5| Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument. 
 Uhh Yeah sure.  Click! Woman At The |1| Uh, would you take one of us? 
 What honey, its like fifteen blocks to the subway. Lets go. |6| Oh no, we cant walk! 
 You can always sell your baby. |6|  I cant believe that you yelled at my boss! Im-Im gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?! 
 But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple ofcigarettes--no big deal. |3| Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking. 
 So...so let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma, then my wife dies, then Emma the one-tiny-ray-of-hope left in my life, gets taken away from me? |3| I lie better than that right?  
 Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can... |2| She's asleep. 
 At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps  |3| Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's... 
 And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.  |1| No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out. 
 You're Jewish. |4|  Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend? 
 But if we win, we get your apartment. |7|  Dah!!  
 Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped. |5| That saves us a conversation. 
 Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off. |3| Yeah. 
 Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs? _B_ |3| Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which. 
  No. Not anymore. |0| Are you being British?! 
 I got something for her.  It's a book! |9| Our place, the hall! I... 
 Prague? |0| Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague. 
  All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds. |6| Look, we are not gonna 
 What about that circled one? |3|  Oh yeah! You'rehey, you're right! Here's an affordable place,  two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks! 
 No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody. |2| Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya.  I'm sorry man. 
 And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry? |8| Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didnt cry. She wasnt angry or sad.  
 Yknow what? I-I kinda have. |7| Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself! 
 Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring! |6| The little jail between the doors! 
 Ahh yes, the messers become the messees! _B_ |8| Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But, see, they don't know that we know that they know! So 
 Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!  |0| Pivot! Piv-at! Piv-at!! 
 The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler! |3| What about my questions? 
  Hi! |9| Really? Thats the thing Im worse at! Youll see.  _B_ 
 Thats a good idea. |4| Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now.  Wow, you sure found that quick.  I justI wish I didnt feel this way about Rachel anymore, yknow? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think I think Ross feels left out. Yknow? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God You shouldve seen the look on Rosss face.  By the way, I have no idea what Im doing here. For all I know Im just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card? 
 Oh, I know! |4| Oh, thank God! 
 You dont? |6| I dont believe in soul mates either. 
 Madre Sierra the of Treasure! |9| Correct! Theres a possible backwards bonus! 
 Period math? |4| Okay, hold on a sec. 
 But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain’t that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright . See, here’s the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go. See, me, I love Tulsa! Tulsa is heaven! Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go there! Ms. |6| You fell asleep? 
 I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight! |7| if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending Christmas with me?  _B_ _B_ 
 Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five? |4| I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker! 
 Mine was a humdinger |9| Yeah. Mine too. 
 Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish!  The Blowfish! |0| Come on.

 Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house. |5| Thank you. _B_ 
 Don't go. |3| Okay. 
 All right. |5| Well, were fashioning a very long poking device. 
 Yeah, well, lucky for you. |6| You didnt even take off your pants. 
 Okay. _B_ |5| Good, and hey! My treat.  But that's only because you're not eating anything, right? 
 And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again? Joey and |6| Yeah! All right? Lets go! 
 Yes you can. Youre thinking about time, you cant go back in time. |7| What are you doing?! Chandler! You cant just go back a phase! 
 No. All right, yknow what, shes  gonna think that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is hand you a library card. Ticket Counter |0| Are you travelling with a child? 
 Whats the second part of your plan? |5| No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan. 
 Why are you screaming and hugging? |7| Okay. Okay.  Ace!  
 You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body! |9| What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?  
 Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more. |4| Really? 
 Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica. |3| They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you. 
 What?! |3| What is wrong with you?!!! 
  See you later.  |8| Hi, honey. 
 That is funny, maybe for my birthday shell murder someone. |7| Maybe Monicas playing a joke on ya. Yknow? Getting her own husband a hooker, thats pretty funny. 
 Whats going on? |4| Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover? 
 Leave it. |9| Oh, blablablabaybaybay. 
 Some guy, Tom Gordon. |3| Who is he? 
 Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!  Closing credits_B_ |5| right now, somewhere out there  our baby could be being conceived. 
 What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do? |4| Ahh! 
 Alright. |5| OK, here I go. I'm goin' in. 
 Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.  |5| Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me? 
 OH MY GOD!!! |5| Yeah, they still wear underwear. _B_ 
 No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay? |6|  A book?  Is it like a book that's also a safe? 
 But if we win, we get your apartment. |7|  Dah!!  
  I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking? |0| Thanks, man, big help. 
 Uh, Dana Keystone from college. |6| Going out with who? 
 Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps. |9| I know, Im sorry! But yknow, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring. 
 Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!" |3| Well, Chandler and I are in a bar 
 Hey.  |8| Hey. Rachel and 
  Was that another question? |4| Oh, Im sorry. Was that another joke? 
 How come? |3| Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise. 
 Okay.  So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh? |0| Yeah. 
 So you you dont want to live with Don in a cheese house? |5| No. I dont think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard. 
 Id like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please. |6| Yes! 
 Yeah. |6| Yeah. 
 No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol?  Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping!  That’s a picture of your daughter, isn’t it, well she’s lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I’ll call you from Tulsa.  _B_ |5| Chandler, I…

 That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole in my head. Mr. |4| Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. That’s how I got my bad hip. 
 You tricked me to get me into bed? |2| I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you saidyou wouldn't have sex with me while we're fighting. 
 Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby? |3| Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns. 
Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle. _B_ |9| How come it's not mixing with the water?

Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby.  Richard? If-if youre in there, could you pass me my credit card? _B_ |0| Oh, I just I feel terrible. 
 Poor Ross.  |0| Oh, my God. 
 I love you. |9| No, Ive had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean? 
 Six! |6| Wise choice, how many rungs? 
 Right here? |5| Well, we could start trying. Now. 
 Y'know but they're right. I'm not a strong father-figure and I never will be. |5| Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about! I mean it's not like they're so responsible. Emma as a product of a bottle of Murlo and a five-year-old condom. 
 But we don't do that. |3| Well, not anymore. 
 Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable. |2|  Hey Chandler. 
 Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life. |1| Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up. 
 Umm, yeah. |0| Women tell each other everything. Did you know that? 
 Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick. |4|  I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me. 
 Whats it about? |4| Baywatch. 
 Hey, Im going for sushi does anybody want..  Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp. |1|  Quick, take off your dress, he wont notice the bed. 
 She doesnt know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I cant even return them, because she choked on the reciept! |1| Oh my God, is she going back to him? 
 Nothing, nothing. |0| What? 
 Hey, look, youre in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, shes gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go. |4| Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, shes very private about her office. Now I know why. 
 Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face? |5|  Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat? 
 Im sure youre right, but why? |2| You idiot!! 
 Which I may say, right now, is out of control. |4| On account of my rage. 
  Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em. |4| No. 
 Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever |7| Dude! How come you took off? 
 In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy. |5|  You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God. 
  Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! |0| Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees... 
  Oh thats great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please?  There we go. |8|  Youre drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe Im a little drunk.  
 So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right.  Its oddly unsettling. |4| Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! Theyre killing me! One toe at a time! 
 Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes! |7| Poor Ross.  
 Im so sorry. |0|  Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep? 
 I feel so used. _B_ |0| That's right, I got mine. 
 Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star! |6| So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment? 
 Hey, this is so unfair! |1| It's worse than the thumb! 
 Where have you been? |7| Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really.  Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place.  No, he's gone.  No no, you don't have to fly back, really.  What do you mean this might be your only chance?  Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.  
 Dangerous Liaisons. |5| Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie... 
 Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake. |3| Chandler, you're not gonna die alone. 
 All right, call it in the air. |4| You got a better idea? 
 Ok. |5| _B_ Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there. 
 Here in Chelsea. |7| Where is this party? 
  What happened?!! |2| Yeah... 
 You dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy and wouldnt live as long.  |3| Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys! 
 I can't believe you did this.  |0| I know- 
  Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe! |2| Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.  _B_ 
 See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area! |6| Yeah, it's good. 
 I think thats gum. |5| But no, because a doctor wont be able to help him, its just gonna yknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years. 
 Believe me, Ive been saying that for years. Oh my God! |4| That cant be your father. 
 Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here! _B_ |9| Uh, your finger was covering the lens. 
 Are you sure? Did you see the stain? |3| Theyre my pants! 
 Yknow what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .  No? Really? They taste so good. _B_ |7| I know. 
 It hurts me. It physically hurts me. _B_ The |0| Really? Me? Wow! I dont even know any huge gay people! _B_ 
  Hungry monkey. |4|  That noise can only me one thing. 
 Wait a minute, its perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and were in a building thats full of beds! |7| No, not here. Maybe here. 
 Ring dammit, ring! |0| "Circle or hoop". 
 Yeah, but it's not who I am. Everything they said is exactly why I was worried about having a kid. And it's true! And, look, everybody knows it. |4| No....You learn these things. You grow into it. 
 How drunk are you? |6| I know, I just thought it would be fun. 
 Really? |5| No you didn't. 
 Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me? |2| Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you. 
 Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this? |0| No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth.... 
 What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you! |3| It's not Rick. 
 Well, it sounds kinda stupid...  Whos she? |1| Lifeguards. 
 Okay.  Its a racecar. |1| Its Monicas bed. What? 
 I dont know, y'know. What, what, would you do? |0| What are you ah, what are you gonna do? 
 It still wouldnt be clean.  All I want is my freedom. |5| What if I clean your bathroom for a month? 
 No. Is there anyway, anyway you think hell understand this? |4| Does Joey know? 
 Well, those were seals, man. _B_ |6| Yeah. 
 Oh, man. Im sorry, Im so-so sorry. |0| You dont tell a guy that youre looking for a serious relationship! You dont tell the guy that! Now you scared him away! 
 There we go! |7| Okay! 
  I don't like your massages. |6| Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell mejust say, "I don't like your massages." 
 No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk. |7| Is something wrong? 
 Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours? |5|  Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team! 
 No! Her boyfriend Richard! |3| Noo! But that would've been so cool! 
 You win. |6| Then keep running.  _B_ 
 Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again? |2| Oh Mon, I laughed so hard 
 Hey!  |8| Santa!  
  How are you feeling? |8|  Hey! Are those crab cakes?  Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready? 
 Hop on. |2| How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride? 
 Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch |1| Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? Its here. 
 What?! |3| Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? Youve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you? 
 So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?  |0| Oh, why is it unfair? 
  Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!!  |7| What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close? 
 Tyrannosaurus!  |0| Stegosaurus! 
 Mazel tov! _B_ Dr. |9| Oh, just had a baby. 
 If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, yknow. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout! |5| Uh huh. Why is that? 
 Heads it is. |5| Heads. 
 No? |6| No. 
 A woman's |5| Who's party is it? 
 Well, thats the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually Ill be in Cuba. |4| Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. Hows it going. This is the hardest letter Ive ever had to write.  What the hells a matter with you? How do you think Joeys going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter? 
  Hey! Which ones my turkey burger? |1| Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else? 
 Oh, yeah, I dont know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.  |2| Well I assume the ah, happy couple isnt up yet. Did you guys hear them last night? 
 What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!! |1|  Awww, man! He promised he wouldnt take the chairs!! 
 Okay.  |5| Yknow you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!! 
 Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together. |3| Who cares? You're Rachel!  Who's Kip? 
 Sorry.  |0| Dude! 
 Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women. |3| Chandler!  Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me. 
 Okay, listen this really hurts. Lets go. |2| Im pretty sure its gun. 
 Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo! |9| Ah whatever! _B_ 
  This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  |9| Oh please, he didnt hear it! He didnt hear it!! 
 Yeah. O-okay. |6| Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready? 
 Thats Mr. Garibaldi playing the piano. |5| What? 
 God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go? |1| No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark. 
 Oh yeah, well, can you picture me saying, "Go to your room! You're grounded!" |9| I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad. At the fun parts and at the hard parts. 
  That's the perfect amount! |8| Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage. 
 My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.  |4| No you did. 
  They're out there! |6| Do you hear something?  
 I got the time to get to know Julie. |7| So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie? 
 Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that? |0| 'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project. 
 We're not gonna talk about girth are we? |3| Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna? 
 Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order. |5| What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her? 
 I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is? |7| No, it's-it's Andrew. 
 Wow! Look at them run. |7| Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.  
 Okay, well it this bed isnt new, how come there is plastic on the mattress? |2| So. This has always been Monicas bed, what youre just noticing now, how self-involved are you? 
 Come on, tell me. |3| Well, it doesnt matter what I would do. 
 Freedom! |8| Foot rubs for a month! 
 I know! I know! |4| Yknow, you should never be allowed to talk to people! 
 I'm still mad at you for not telling me. |6| Me neither, y'know what- 
 Let's go quicker. |5| Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it. 
 Well, why can't you do them tomorrow? |2|  I didn't finish my five pages. 
 Okay, but now see you're crying! |2|  See? It's no big deal. 
 You dove in front of Ross! Ross! |9| Okay. 
 All right, let me in.  |4| That's right baby. 
 When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it! |8| It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me? 
  What? What? |1| I thought it was Chandler! 
 It doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far? |5| Well, what did you have? 
 Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird turtle-man? |7| What are you doing here, Santa? 
 Honey, I know youre in pain right now, but Im a little turned on. _B_ |1| Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first.  Ah Ooh Oohh Ohh Oh God Ohh Oh Ohh Ohhhh 
 You dont owe me anything, I dont want you money |1| Give me a number, I dont want to owe you anything! 
 Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall. _B_ |2| But pleasure is important,  and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor? 
 What?! |3|  Hey, you know our phone's not working? 
 Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches. |4| Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it? 
 Ok!  |7|  Hey, listen. Call me. 
 Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.  |1| No, I'll do it.  
 Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there. |6| You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone. 
 We have to assign heads to something. |2| Yes! Whew! 
 Alright, hang on a second there Custer. |3| No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys. 
  Chelsea. |6| What woman?! 
 What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela? |6| All right, look, look, youve got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy. 
 SoYou got in voluntarily?! |7| Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didnt think big enough to fit a grown man! 
 Oh, dont say that! Dont say that. Thats not true. Is it? |3| No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just wouldve just stepped aside. 
 Yeah baby! |9| Uh-huh, not as high as  It worked! King! 
 And you're okay with that? |3| Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work? 
 Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!" |2| Go on, teach me something about men and women. 
 Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay! |7| Yknow uh, actually I-I-I should get going. 
  Im right here! |7| Hey well, you cant teach someone to be good with women. Yknow, thats why I never had any luck with Chandler. 
  Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and dont talk to anyone. |7| I really wish that you wouldnt. 
 Well, I feel like a snack! |5|  I can do an English accent?! That babys going on my résumé! _B_ 
 Hes coming into the audience. Hes coming into the audience. |5|  For Im loved by a pretty wonderful boy!  Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars.  
 Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'! |9| You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence? 
 Oh dear God! |1| Fine.  Shes wearing my bra! 
 Well, lets just say its ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself. |6| Why? You saw it? Is it scary? 
 Tell it to the Time Turtle! |3|  Oh.  Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second! 
 You said that to me last week. |4| Can you hear me say you're grounded? 
 Wrong number? |2| Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye.  
  Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game! |0| Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking! 
 Fancy. |6| Everyday use. 
  New York is awesome! |9| Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming. 
 Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go. |1| Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know. 
 Yeah, okay. |2| Nooo! 
 Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself? |5| He's... new. 
 Yeah, Ill go get one. |5| They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer? 
 What?  What are you, what are you talking about? |4| All right, youre probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me,  I would ah, I would bow out. 
 Freedom! I want my freedom! Why wont you here me?!  Sophie, help me! Help me!!  |3| Ill take all of your photos and put them into photo albums! 
 Well, yknow, youre-youre gonna meet somebody! Youre a great catch! Yknow when I was telling all those guys about you, I didnt have to lie once.  |4| Oh! See just Im right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!  
 What? |4| I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work. 
 Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked! |2| Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success. 
 I do not hate Ross! |0| That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross! 
 What? |4|  No-no! Don't do it! Don't! 
 Thanks.  |9| You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you. 
 Sorry, my my thing was in there with me. _B_ |1| You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing! 
 Not 700 exactly? |0| Uh,  wow, 700. 
 Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible! |4| Well, yknow what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think Im just gonna take Sebastian to the charity. 
 So do you think uh, Joeys more charming than me? |8| Thats not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow Im not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.  Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.  
  Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me. |3| And shes back in the game. _B_ 
 What? |4| I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember? 
 Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her! |1| I couldn't even if I wanted to. _B_ 
 Howdy doody. |5| Sure.  _B_ 
 Oh thats all right sir, and thats just one girl. |7| Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls. Huh? 
 I dont know, five hundred dollars? |3| Ah-ah-ah! Were doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those? 
  I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off! |0| I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer. 
 This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants. |8| Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache? 
 What? |4|  Y'know what's weird? 
 Work people? Nobody told me. |0| Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people. 
 You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya? End|7| Oh, thank you.  
 Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy! |8| Hi 
  Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec?  Your tailor is a very bad man! |3| Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you. 
 What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday? _B_ |7| Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads. 
 Can I be that guy? _B_ |4| Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?  
  Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here? |8| Where in Cuba? _B_ 
 Hey, Lowell. |7|  Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something. Closing Credits _B_ 
 Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free. |1| Okay, well be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today? 
 BEND OVER?!!! _B_ |4| I was tryin to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what Im gonna do? 
 You gotta let me slam the door!  |7| Chandler- 
 Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub. |7| Oh my God!  
  Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done. |6| Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work. 
 It's true. |9| No way! 
 Oh, hey guys! |9| Hey! Look who I found! 
 Oh no-no-no, thats notNo-no-no! |2| Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I dont feel that way about you. 
 Pheebs!! |9|  Speech! Speech! Lets hear from the birthday girl! Huh? 
 Oh no thanks. I dont like anything from my Scottish heritage. |5| Do you want some shortbread? Eh thats Scottish like you are. 
 See Joe, not that thats not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Yknow, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us! |8| Yes! 
 And yet you dont recognize that youre crazy. |9| My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap! 
 Please, one ridiculous problem at a time! |0| I look like a man' 
 That's great! |9| It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list. 
  Ross' shirt is torn. |0|  Oooh! They are in for a world of pain! 
 Fancy guest. |1| Guest. 
 Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know. |6| What is with you? 
 If you guys feel this big , maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel. |1| I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys. 
 And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard. _B_ |8| And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't. _B_ 
 I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up. |0| What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph. 
 Yeah! All right! You go first. |8| Yeah? 
 Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us. |1| No, that's not exactly what I was.. 
 Well, hello! |6| No, no, no, dont get up, I got a cooler right here. _B_ 
 Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four? |6| The Geller Cup. 
 Hi. |8| Hello. 
 Then why didnt you tell me to do that?!! |1| He loves you. 
 Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right? |9| Really? 
 It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything. |6|  My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages. 
 Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked! |8| I did not! 
 What picture? |5| Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture. 
 Double it!  |9| Yeah. 
 Yeah, you wish.  |7| Yeah! Thats why Im sleeping with him on the side. 
 Now Monica, I know youre upset, but dont forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then theres going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris. |1| I cant believe her, yknow its justits so typical. 
 Im still right here! |8| Hey! No-no-no-no, you cant take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!! 
  Its a nickname, Ill explain later. |4| Hello Skidmark. 
 You bet I did, Ben, put it there!   Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small!  Ho, ho, ho! |0| Did you bring me any presents, Santa? 
 Ross is Batman! |7| Really?! Commercial Break _B_ 
 Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!  _B_ |2| She's bluffing! 
 Oh relax man, relax. Youre looking a little flushed. |9| Thats funny. Yeah. Yknow youre the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear. 
 Its a hand. Its a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder. |6| BingWhats this?!  
 Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots. |1| Okay, five hundred dollars. What else? 
 Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache! |2| Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him. 
 I know. |5| This doesn't feel weird! 
 You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person. |2| No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza. 
 Let me tell you why you need to pick me.  See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back. |1| Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross. 
 Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party. |3| Tell me about it. 
 Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with?  Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.  Y'know, I feel like I've lost her..  Ba-! _B_ |0| Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza-  Hey, that's not for you, bitch!  _B_ 
 Im here to see Mary-Angela. |6| Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you? 
 So how's it going there in Financial Services? |8| Hey, Chandler. 
 Excuse me, Doug?  Hey there sports fan!! |9|  Fights over!  _B_ 
   Coffee house? |5|  WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!! 
 Im gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just  _B_ |4| No! God, would you just calm down!  
 Okay.  |5| Okay. 
 Tickets please!  Thats courtside baby! |5| I dont know! 
 Again true. |9| Well that's pathetic! 
 I'm not a dropper! |3| Oh yeah, that's right! 
 Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter. |7| Yknow, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden. 
 No-noReally?! |6| Im sorry Chandler, yknow you are such a sweet guy and I, I dont want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better. 
 Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland by Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.  |3| What?! 
 No, not us  Us!  |2| Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember? 
 Heres another plan No! |3| Heres the plan! Okay? Im going to leave you get a look at Brendas bra! 
  Oh come on!! |2| Id like to spin the wheel!  
 Nngghhh!!!!!!! |6| Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone? 
 You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand! |8| It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here! 
 Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming? |8|  Oh! Great! So how much does it pay?  _B_ 
 Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?  _B_ |8| Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...  
 Joey's tailor...took advantage of me. |9|  Hey, what's goin' on?  
 In a bad way? |8| Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different. 
 Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back. _B_ |0| No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'. 
 Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife. |0| Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department. 
 Okay. |5| Okay, okay, I'll go first. 
 You. |6| So what do you want? 
 Do you have any beers? Were out of beers. |5| Hey. 
 Okay, good. Commercial Break _B_ |5| Yeah. 
 No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again? |0| Your thinking about my leg arent you? 
 Oh, it doesnt matter.  Hey, yknow what, Ive got two tickets to tonights Rangers game, you wanna come with me? |2| No. 
 You put your fist through the wall? |4| Im not proving anything. Okay, Im done listening to you. If I hadnt let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never wouldve put my fist through the wall! 
 No, no, youre right, it is a ridiculous name! |0| Dude, I am sorry about what I said! 
  Hey! |8| Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out. _B_ 
 The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed. |1| Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played. 
 Okay, you give the worst massages in the world. |2| Oh my God! You don't know me at all! 
 I wish I had smoked for my career |2| All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career! 
 Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me! |4| I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing! 
  Next time? |0| I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you. 
 Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it. |3| What? 
 Okay, one more time. |4| Oh Ross, calm down, Ill give you the 80 cents.  _B_ 
  I KNEW IT!!!! _B_ |7| And hey! Just so you know, its not that common! It doesnt happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!! 
 We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la . |9| Paris? 
 Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight. |5| Its pretty clear. 
 Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond! |4| Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time. 
 What question? |6|  Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question. 
 Oh no-no-no! |2| No, its a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. Were gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there! 
  This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.  Okay, here we go. |3| Shes right of course not. Honey, get the tape. 
 Do you want a calculator? |3| Okay, so thats another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, thats  
 Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air... |7| Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters. 
 Well, I have kissed over four women.  Do you wanna get under the covers? |3| You're a really good kisser. 
 Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection.  Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing. |9| Rach?!  Rachel!!!!?  So I can't do anything I like'' _B_ 
 You think I should? |1| Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are. 
 You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.  |7| I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike. 
 You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.  |7| I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike. 
  Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make "groom" for Chandler. |9| All right fine, I pick you. 
 You told him to play the boxer gay!! |5| Thanks, any suggestions?  _B_ 
 Wheres Mary-Angela? |7| You are so the man!  Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, cause my Grandma doesnt know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah. 
 Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk.... |2| Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday. 
 Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not. |6| It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you? 
 No, I ah, I didnt do them. |8|  Bing! You got those numbers for me? 
 How do ya do. |7| And Rachel.  And thats Chandler. 
  But you found me! |8|  There you are! Haaah, you got away from me! 
 No they didnt! _B_ |2| Seriously, good game though. Good game.   What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back! 
 Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks. |1| But hey, Ross, this place is available now! 
 All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way. |2| And this goes for all guys? 
 It's throwing and catching! |7| It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know? 
 Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica thats as good as garbage? |1| Or we could just follow your clever jokes  any ideas? No! Didnt think so! Okay, cmon guys, show us where the presents are! 
 Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup?  Oh-ohhhh! |9|  Chandler! 
  Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh |0| Of course! 
 You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work! |2|  What are you doing? 
 Why? |4| I would do it but she thinks Im attracted to her! 
 Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something? |3| Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone? 
 So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes. |2| Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand... _B_ 
 Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did. |1| Karen. 
 Princess Leia in the gold bikini. |7| So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing.... 
 Nono, just you. |9| You have me! 
 You okay? |3|  Help yourself. 
 No, wed just like to close them. Bank |1| No-no. 
 Well, actually its a hockey team, so its angry Canadians with no teeth. |0| Cute guys in little shorts? Sure. 
 Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name. |7| Its not that bad. 
 Yes that was mine. |5| Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room. 
 Just a little bit of sugar. |7| Oh, none for me. Thanks. 
 Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you. |4| I'm crying here!! 
  Really? |5| So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight. 
 When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line. |1| Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I knew you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us! 
 There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again! |5| Ooh, so close. 
 Hey, I didnt make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.  Dont get to excited because thats not gonna happen unless you getNo way!  _B_ |0| Really? 
 Yeah, Im not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore. _B_ |1| Oh and  Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach  or uh, or saying mmm and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay? 
 Perfect decibel. |3| Chandler, would you like some more orange juice? 
 Who? |5| Im not writing about you! Im writing about other people. 
 Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because its romantic, but because I can! |8| Keep talking. 
 You-you-you didnt know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done! _B_ |5| Thats why you broke up with me? 
  Here I am. |5| Where's Chandler? 
 Batman has a utility belt! |6| What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets! 
 It cant happen like this. Okay? Ill meet you back at the hotel.  |4| No-no I heard! Im just sorry. 
 Why dont you go up on stage. Ill get a picture of you doing the speech. |6| Hey Rach. _B_ 
 Theres no question. |1| Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross? 
 Why have I seen this thing three times?! |0| Okay.  Ooh, my!  Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?! 
 Here!  |7| Please! 
 Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends. |1| Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!  
 Okay!  |7| Hm-hmm! 
 Yeah? |7| Honey? 
 Okay. |5| I really do, yeah. 
 Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father? |6| Well, if there is anything else you wanna know...  
 Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite... |0| No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years. 
 You totally screwed him over. |2| Well, I-I mightve said supergay. 
 Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day! |8| Oh! Wow! Hey! 
  Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.  |2|  You betcha! _B_ 
 No. No. I dont think so. |2| How much it bothers you? because I dont like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time? 
  He has sex, and we get hit in our heads. _B_ |4| Oh!!  You guys knew about this and you didnt tell us?! 
 Really. |4| I know. That's what I told her. 
 No, no I just ah, didnt do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly dont deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise. |2| Oh, you forgot? 
 God!!  What am I gonna do?! |0| I remember you did. 
 Dangerous Liaisons. |5| Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie 
 Kill me. Kill me now.  |1| Here, Ross, take our picture.  Smile! You're on Janice Camera! 
  Hey! |8| Well, I brought the next best thing. 
 Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good! |6| No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up. 
 Oh! Oh! That's so hard.   |7| All right.  
 Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep. |1|  Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed. 
 Well maybe there is one thing you can do. |6| Ohh, Im sorry. 
 Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me? |7| I know, Monica told me. 
 Why? |4| Thank you, but, but you gotta leave. 
 I fear a jury will see it the same way! |4| Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on were a team! Were in this together! 
 I think we may have really done it this time. |6| Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast. 
 I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide.   |8|  Yeah...  Oh, great. More party boys for Chandler! 
 I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk?  "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..." Spit it out, David! |8| Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go. 
 I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk?  "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..." Spit it out, David! |8| Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go. 
 Can we read it? Can you print out another copy? |2| Yeah. 
 Joey and I can finish up in the guest room. |7| We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in. 
 Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish. |1| Why? 
 Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer. |5| Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man. 
 I know! |5| Yes! 
 Lose the other guys. |4| Whaddyou mean? 
 Right. |6| Phoebe moved out. 
 Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.  |2|  Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.  
 Have you ever been with a woman? |5| Well that sounds fun too.   
 I have no name. |3| So, youre just Bing? 
 Yes that would have made more sense. |4| 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there. 
 Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk? |1| And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing. 
 Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes! |7| Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that? 
 Yes. |6| Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven? 
 From a bullet! |4| Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich. 
 That's so funny, because I think I just did! |4| I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do! 
 Basically we just feel that he's... |1| I dunno, there's just something about... 
 Hes being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness! |3| Thats very funny! 
 Okay, is this lamp in the same place? |0| That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didnt you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan?  The neighbor's dog. _B_ 
 Its my joke. Ross and |0| Its my joke. 
  Here you go Joe, heres the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.  |8| Okay, you watch too much TV. 
 Are you funny? |7| No reason, its just I know a single guy that cares about other people. 
 You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers! |3| Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!  _B_ 
 How did you know?  _B_ |5| Wash your hands!!! 
 Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade. |2| Yep. Ice Capades. 
 I think its necessary.  |6| Oh-ho, I think its nice. 
 See Joe, we want you to tell stories but yknow, romantic stories. Nice stories. |7| Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side effects! 
 Batman has the Batmobile! |9| 007 has a fancy car! 
  You picked Ross?! |1| So you think Ross too?  
 also I was the point person on my companys transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system. The |5| Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says its time to go, its time to go.  _B_ 
 Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes |2| All right, what else? 
 What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl! |9| THAT'S NOT ME! 
 It bodes well for me that speed impresses you. |9| Wow! You are really fast! 
 But honey you don't have to. |0| About that? Erm...I'm going to change. 
 Okay. |5| Okay. 
 Thanks man. |9| No, 19. 
 That's great. |8| Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college.  
 Cupping. |5| What? 
 Good save! We're back on track, and I'm...  ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.  |0| Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.  
 So- you can tell? |9| Yeah. 
 Doug!! |9| Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller.  Thats okay, youre still my number one guy!  Bing! 
 I wanna quit the bank! _B_ |1| Hi, Im Karen. 
 Why?! Why do I have to tell him?! |0| Well, Chandler, youre gonna have to tell him. 
 What happened? What happened?! |0| Hes doin some thinkin! _B_ 
  For an emergency just like this. |5| Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway? 
 Oh, you get used to it. |9|  How does that laugh not give you a headache? 
 Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so |4| Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica! 
 I think you smell great!  _B_ |9| Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.  
 Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers. |4| Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip. 
 Hey. |8|  Hey! 
 Its my joke. |0| Its my joke. Ross and 
 I was asleep.  Oh no! No-no honey! Yknow whats sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy. |4| How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room. 
 Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday? |2| What?! Anything! Anything! 
 Hmm. |6| Okay fine! Fine! Then you know what, Ill just write about Phyllis! Hmm! 
 Okay, dont say anything, you might scare it away.  |2|  Bonjour, monsieur. 
 Can you people not see me?!  |5| Yeah. Sure.  
 But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly. |0| Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-youre wrecking it. 
 We heard you play all the way from your apartment! |8| How did you know about that?! 
 You see that? |6| Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at womans breasts all the time! 
 You may wanna get some more of those too.  |8| Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test. 
 Kori? Kori Weston? |4| Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service. 
  Why did you look at me when you said that? |3| Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats y'know, for all your tiaras and stuff. 
 Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish. |3| Why would you kill his fish? 
 No freakshow, she's fictional. |4| Really? 
 Okay. |5| Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go. 
 C'mon, we're great together, why not? |7| ...Like, ...all of them? 
 Noo!! You dont have a boyfriend because....I dont, I dont know why you dont have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend. |3| I dont understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I dont have a boyfriend? 
 Thats-thats my nubbin. |0| Whats that? 
 So there is no good time to ask that question. _B_ The |3| What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?! 
 Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint. |5| All right, so, what are we supposed to call you? 
 It's a kitchen slash bathroom. |2|  How about you? 
 Absolutely! |8| So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica? 
 Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean. |5| You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean? 
 Much sense?! |3| I know it doesn't make much sense 
 We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once. |5| Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon. 
 Fine with me! |7| Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you. 
  No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked. |0| Who cares? I repel women. _B_ 
 Yeah? |7| Thanks!  Yeah, theres pulp in that.  
 Its Paris, who knows were here! |7| Okay, dont say anything, you might scare it away.  
 Ross came in fourth and cried! |5| All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won! 
 Batman has Robin!  We get ESPN right? |6| 007 gets all the ladies. 
 I cannot believe you didnt pick me. |2| Ross is really strong! Okay, hes the strongest out of all three of you!  Except for Joey. 
 That I did. That I did. The |5| You mustve had your hands full. 
 Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican. |4| Which were still keeping under our hats! 
 Is that a problem? |2| That bastard taped over me!  
 Yep! |8| We're gonna see each other naked. 
 Where's Emma? |2| You may wanna get some more of those too.  
 Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are! |7| I'm going to get bigger! 
 I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory. |5| Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss. _B_ 
  You couldn't be cool.  |4| Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here. 
 Whoa! Don't know about that. _B_ |4| You are ready to make a commitment! 
 Oh-ho-ho-ho.  |6|  This is from the woman at the bar. 
 So you don't think I have a, a quality? |3| Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar. 
 Im a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself. |7| Hmm. 
 Yeah, I know. |5| Because you do. 
 Oh!  |7| Correct. In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14? 
 So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal? |2| Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things. 
  Hey! |8| Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, Im gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, Ill set you up with a clean one.  Okay, Im sorry. I didnt mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? Cause lets face it, were at Monicas.  I broke it. All right. Well, thats just the way that goes.  Okay, good.  Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you cant answer.  Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words!  Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh!  Oh, youre a lot mischievous! Well, itll dry.   Okay, you sit with your brother and sister nowwho arent there!  _B_ 
 What? |4| No, dont look directly at them! 
 Oh nothing, were just talking. Yknow, blah-blah-blah. |1| So uh, what are you guys doing? 
 Lets have Monica decide. |5| Yknow, I dont think were going to settle this. 
 Would you please get some rest! |5| Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that Im not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.  
 Well, the heart wants what it wants. Ill see you later.  _B_ |5| Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie? 
 Oh. |5|  Phyllis is sitting in a chair. 
 Hey. |8| Hey. 
 Fine, I'll give the suit back. _B_ |0| I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me. 
 Thats not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding. |9| Were you the ones called the cops?! 
 All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if its not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?! |7| Do you see this?  
 Wait, you guys, look! |7| Oh, my God!  
 No, no that's ok. You're totally right I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But...you did hurt my feelings...so, I want you to know that if I die, you don't get Joey. _B_ _B_ |0| Hey dude, you ok? Sorry bout before. 
 Wow! You look amazing! |9| Yeah... 
 Thank you. |9| Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else. 
 Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman. |4| Okay. 
 ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!' |2| Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too. 
 Oh-ho, come here.  Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman Ive ever known in real life. _B_ |9| Well, I think so. 
  Yes... thank you. That was... that was.... |8| My God, you're choking!  That better? 
 Its kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing. |6| Whats a nubbin? 
 I have the lung capacity of a two year old.  |6| Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed. 
 Did she call? |2| What the heck is that?  _B_ 
 Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off? |0| No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint. 
 We are bad people. |2| All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.  
 I paid for those tickets! |4| How about we settle this right now!  There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha! 
 Yeah!  _B_ |8| Okay. I suck! 
 Oh yeah, it's so cool.  Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100.  That's pee-pee.  |4| So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you? 
 Uh, Joey is gonna be right back. Right back!  Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you.  So, you're old and small. _B_ |8| Joey! 
 So you risked your life, for a sandwich! |9| Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it! 
 Yeah. |6| Don't worry, it's out there!  I think I just need lunch. 
 Yeah, I'm not so worried. |1| Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isnt about the room, this is about what the room represents! And unfortunately, this room  could destroy you!! 
 What is the matter with you ?!? |5| Ohh, I love birds.  
 Im sorry, I guess I just like the pulp. |0| I thought we talked about this. I dont like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isnt juice. All juice, okay? 
 Joe? |4| " by doin it." 
 Actually, I dont like martinis. |4| How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and Ill make you a nice martini. 
 Okay, give me a second!  Did you clean up in here? |3| You go back out there, and you seduce her till she cracks! 
 Oh really?! You think youre stronger? Why dont you prove it?  |4| Uh, in her defense, shes right. I am stronger. I would destroy you. 
 Why would she do that? |0| Maybe she meant to get you a hooker. 
 Youre turning into a woman. |1| Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut. _B_ 
  My duties?  All right. The |8| So lets talk a little bit about your duties. 
 Yes, money well spent! |8| What the hell are you talking about,  "The south will rise again man." 
 Count of three? |4| Do you wanna do it at the same time? 
 Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you! |0| Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma? 
 What? |4| You were great. But they still made fun of you. 
 It's ok, it's ok. You know what?  I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter.  |1| Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds! 
 So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too? |1| Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped. 
 Hey, big... |9| Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!? _B_ 
 I'm goin' home. |8| Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad? 
 Uh-oh. _B_ |5| Okay! All right! How was she? _B_ 
 I dont think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.  Draw!!   |9|  One second.  _B_ 
  Im telling ya, Joannas got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, This was fun. Lets do it again sometime. Ill give you a call. |2| Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming cause, cause her eyes keep going like this.  
 He is? |3| Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is. 
 No, no. It-its not about the swearing, its more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock. |7| Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass! 
 Ohh, she's-she's not really my type. |7|  So? Huh? What do you think? 
 Hey! |8| Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this. _B_ 
 Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we- |0|  Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter. 
 Oh.  |5| I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect. 
 Well, lets just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours. |4|  How do you feel? 
  I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked. |1|  What?! 
 Yeah! |8| Yeah! 
 Oh my good God. |4| Damnit Carl! _B_ 
 Ehh. |3| Listen umm, Ive been thinking, its not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that. 
 Santa? Really? |5|  Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?  
 Because we hate them. |6| Why not? 
 Oh youve got to be kidding me. |0| I cant believe were here. 
 You need new clothes. _B_ |3| Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, youll know its mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, theres a very noticeable rip. 
 No, the babys out! Look, look! |7| What? Did her ass explode?! 
 your ass?!?!? |7| Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too. 
 Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all. |0| And you are... 
 Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please? |7| I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow. 
 Well maybe he was nervous. _B_ |5| _B_ Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect. 
 And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place.... |6| Hmph. 
 I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish... |7| So... which one of the two guys will you listen to? 
 Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as...  Ahh, what? |0| You have three nipples? 
 Well its very unsettling. _B_ |4| Then why are you smoking? 
  I wasnt doing anything.  Uh-oh, what did she do now? |0| I dont think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.  Draw!!   
 Fancy. |6| Everyday use. 
 All right, maybe I should call her. |1| No, sorry. 
 Its Clint. Its Clint!  |1| Umm, Gene. 
 Oh yeah!  _B_ |8| No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did! 
 So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me. |7| I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world! 
 Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ. |1| I tried! They won't take her back. 
 Isn't that Ross's money? |3| You wanna eat?  My treat! 
 What are you talking |6| No it is not! 
 Youre arranging flowers!  You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!! |6| What? 
 Oh-oh. |0|  Phyllis sees what Im doing. 
 Isnt that what happened with you and the bridesmaid? |5| Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing yknow youre in the bathtub together and shes feeding you strawberries? 
 Ooh, yum!  |9| How about a Youhoo with a funny straw? 
 Oh, you're-you're going? |7| Of course. _B_ 
 And the world will never know. |9| Keep dancing. _B_ 
 This is the worst bachelor party ever! |0| Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything youre really bad at yknow, sexually? 
 Now Ive upset you? What did I say? |4| No Im not. Why would you say that? Thats just mean. 
 Id like a Google Card. |3| Now, over to Chandler. 
  I see. The |7| Now youll be heading a whole division, so youll have a lot of duties. 
 Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food |4| Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent! 
 Two! |7| One! 
 Okay.  |5| Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell. 
 Then, I don't get it. |1| You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!" 
  Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and..  Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. . |4| Okay good. 
  Excuse me.  . That didn't make us sound gay at all! |0|  You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?  
 The Hitlers will be so disappointed. |0| Well... I just talked to Sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on the house... a-a-and I'll bet we get it. 
 Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are. |3| Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong. 
  ...spender. |8| Shhhh! 
 _B_ Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. _B_ Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor. |5| ...what the hell does she want with half a boat... _B_ 
 Thats what you say at the end of a date. |5| Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks youre going to call her? 
 Out of my league. I could get a Brian.  If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian.  Hey, Brian. End|1| Yup, and waaay out of your league.  
 Oh, and dont get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. Its just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, its making all the other guys jealous. |2| Oh? 
 Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!! |1|  Oh my God! What happened? 
 Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings. |8| Not your type?! She's gorgeous! 
 Is that a real thing? |4| Hey! Samboucha Margarita? 
 No thanks, Mom!  |8|  Okay, Ive got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties? 
 I'm sorry you misunderstood... |0| Oh, no. Oh, no. 
  Oh no! No! No! No!  |0| Joey has got a secret peephole! 
 What? |4|  Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee. Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself.  Did you hear what I said Bing? 
  Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch. |3| No! That's-that's my arm! 
 And protected them from a tornado?  |7| Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed em, bathed em, and put em to bed. 
 Oh great! |8| Oh, this ones for Chandler. Here. 
 Mon, get out here! |5| Hey Mon. 
 Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now. |4| Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs. 
 Pheebs, were not giving you a deposit for our wedding! |9| Yknow, just some good faith money to hold the date. 
 Look, I thought about it too, and Im sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding. |1| Eh, you work for that. 
  Where's Monica? |2| See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.  
 Knit, good woman, knit, knit!  _B_ |9| Okay.  
 Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa? |6| Yes, is that okay? 
 We have heard you play. |8| Come on thats not fair! I mean you havent even heard me play! 
 I did.  But it came at a price. |3| Chandler sucks! He couldnt have gotten this good! 
 And look how happy the mom is now! |9| Oh, look at those little fingers and toes! 
 They...do that? |4| Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too! 
 Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!  |3| You are married though. 
 Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true. |6| Thank you. My hair is very amused. 
 Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman Alison, from work, she's great. She's pretty. She's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing. |8| That's fine. 
 Monica, it's 630 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over. |1| Try the bottom one.  Closing Credits _B_ 
 I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know! |5| With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa! 
 ...The second guy. |4| Which one? 
 Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross. |3| Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency. _B_ 
 You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come? |7| Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave. 
 Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth. |8| Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks shes like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread! 
 715.  Watch doesnt work. |4| One. 
 No! |2| I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts. 
 Fancy guest. |1| Guest. 
 Really?! |5| No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother! 
 I don't know. |2| Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat? 
 Of course! |8| You still want to move in together right? 
 Youre turning into a women. |9| Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers theyre just, you know, theyre nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby. 
 Okay, anything for you sir? |5|  Iced tea. 
 I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.  |5| For further reading on the above story, please check out The One Where Joey Moves Out.} 
 And thats the Chrysler Building right there. Mr. |9| Knit, good woman, knit, knit!  _B_ 
 Hm-hmm, I told you!  I cant believe that Ive only got two hours before I call in sick for work. |0| That really was some of your best work. 
  It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy we're gonna have all the sex. |7| Umm, not without you, lover.  So, this is my bra. 
 Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives. |9| Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet? 
 Hi honey Im home. |9| Ohh!  And I love spending time with you.  _B_ 
 Yes!  No!  Google! |5| Are you sure? 
  Good to know. The |7| But therell be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them. 
 They do? |3| Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss. 
  They loved it. |9| Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store. 
 Ross, that was 16 years ago! |7| You broke the pact! 
 How's it going? |9|  How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?  _B_ 
 I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.  |0| No... he killed his father with a shovel.  But other than that, he's a great guy. 
 Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here. |9| All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see you later, neighbor.  
 Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used. |3| You did? How? 
 So how'd it go? |4| She's still asleep. 
 Fine.  |6| Fine. 
 Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women? |1| Look, it's just a little more complicated... 
 Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way. |6| Alright. 
 Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed. |4| This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this? 
 To her face? Look its the end of the date, Im standing there, I know all shes waiting for is for me to say Ill call her and its just y'know, comes out. I cant help it, its a compulsion. |4| You cant just say, Nice to meet you, good night? 
 Okay.  |5| Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! Youre okay. 
 Uhh, no-no thanks. |7| Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date! 
 Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something. |6| Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now. 
 Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong? |7| Hes right, what she did was unforgivable. 
 Its Clint! Clint! |8| Bye, Gene. 
 Oh, will you give me the thing.   |7| Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.   
 Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year. |7| Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming.  Hey, what's up?  
 When did that happen to you?! |2| Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time. 
 Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir. |4| The joke Bing. What's the matter with you? 
 Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is. |1| Monica!  
 Oh, the mixed tape.  |5| I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me. 
  Turns out he is kinda funny. Commercial Break _B_ |4| Okay! See you later!  
 Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I dont care!  |2| Oh, I see.  _B_ 
 Yeah, Im putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then thats what were gonna do. |5| You do?! 
 Why not?  |4| Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there. 
 Then it's okay!  |4| No. 
 Okay, you ready for the last picture? |6| Well go! Go move it!  
 Couldn't be more out.  |8| Chandler? 
  In a minute? Whats gonna happen in a minute?! |0| In a minute! 
 Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?! _B_ |1| But Ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this. 
 You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing? |5| No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him? _B_ 
 Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined. |6| Three!  
 Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. |5| Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself? 
 God why why would you want to do that to yourself!? |0| It's kind of a package deal! 
 I didn't know Ross and you were so close. |5| I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad. 
 Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet. |2| Do you think they recognize each other from in there? 
 Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet. |2| Do you think they recognize each other from in there? 
 I'll take that. |9| Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you? 
 Okay, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. Okay, in fact I kind of like the last pound. Okay, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret. |0| No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'. 
 Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom. |2| Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here. _B_ 
 You said... |6| Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you? 
 Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.  _B_ |1|  Well, call me if you change your mind.  
  Hey! Howd the interview go? |8| Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes. 
 Hmmm, thats very cool. |7| All right Ill talk in code.  Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway? 
 I think somebody has a crush on somebody. |4| God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, Oh, Im so talented. and Oh, Im so pretty, and Ooh, I smell so good. 
 With extra pulp? |4| I ah Oh! Ill squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning! 
 Oh my God! |4| No! _B_ 
 Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her? |2| All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out! 
 Okay. |5| Okay! 
 Thanks.  |9| Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me,  here. 
 Okay! |7| Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear! 
 Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him. |6| Ross didnt scare you? 
 Now Ive upset you? What did I say? |4| No Im not. Why would you say that? Thats just mean. 
 Okay! Okay! Okay! |7| Ooh, lets open them! 
  Of course it is.  Wowwhoa! |6| Its hard for some people! 
 Well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes |2| I have to be up in seven minutes. 
 Not if I kiss you first.  |7| You should be. I'm very bendy.  I'm gonna kiss you now. 
 But youre not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet. |2| No-no! No! No! You dont tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks Im a soap actor. 
 Were you just ten seconds later! |4| Who are you? 
  Youre going down. |5| Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse. 
 It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldnt give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird! |0| From the tequila factory? 
 Nooo!! |1| Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, youve been Bamboozled! 
 No dont I beg of you! The |5| We can go into detail 
 I just wan't to... |2| Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore. 
 They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter. |3| What? 
 I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.  All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts. |0| That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship. 
  That's what I was doing too. |4|  Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding. 
 Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake!  |3| Are you awake? 
 Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off. |5| Oh, me too...  
 The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me. |7| Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed? 
 Then what? |3| Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... 
 Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other? |8| Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July. 
  Hi.  |8| Chandler! Chandler!  
 Ahhhhh!  _B_ |3| Ha!  Ahhhhhhh! 
 I KNEW IT!!!! Closing Credits _B_ |7| And hey! Just so you know, its not that common! It doesnt happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!! 
 Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.  |7| Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too. 
 Its-its about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually. |4| Whats up? 
 Well y'know, what if she didnt actually sleep with the guy? |6| How might you be wrong? 
 Okay. |5| Umm, I'd love too!  Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek. 
 Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging. |0| Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a pictureI didn't have my camera! 
 Well, I just |4| Excuse me? 
 Because youre the only one that can be fair. |3| Why do I have to decide? 
 Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cats name? |2| I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you! 
 What?!  _B_ |3| Ohh. 
 Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, yknow? Well pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college. |8| Oh, youre so sweet.  Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff? 
 Well, I, I should go in there. |3| Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing. 
 Get ready to run.  Congratulations on your wedding.  _B_ |9| Yeah. 
 Why me?! |0| All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave. 
 Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it look like?! |8| No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out. 
 Eh!  _B_ _B_ |6| Eh, we weren't that close anyway! 
 Really? He does?  Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!  |4|  Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you. 
 Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet? |3| I thought I was something that we both wanted! 
 I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently. |4| We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him. 
 Monica's grandmother. |7| Who's that dirty old lady? 
 Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it. |6| You want his yearbook? 
 Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have. |7| Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What? 
 Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok? |0| Ow! 
 She was not good. Not good. |3| Awful! Horrible! 
 Im talking about you. You big, big freak. |6| Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know? 
 No! |2|  Yeah!! 
 How do you know?! |6| Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do! 
 What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in! |1| Come on, two on one. 
 Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here? |0| Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that. _B_ 
 Yeah, you almost overreacted to something. Phoebe and |5| Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!!  Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close. 
 Too dry. |2| Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry? 
 Okay! , the coffee table forward , and taped a square outline on the floor.) |6| Come here, I want to show you something! 
 Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later. |7| Is it the same thing that Chandler had? 
 Wait, we cant do this. Phoebe and |5| Hee hee! 
 Its not all juice!  _B_ |8|  Okay look, Chandler, if this  you have got to listen!   Youre gonna throw that juice at me, arent ya? 
 What a great apology!  And you accept! Okay, bye-bye! |1| Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didnt want to talk to anyone, especially me? 
 Hey!!! |8| Chandler one time wore my underwear to work! 
 Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.  |9|  Shes still here. 
 Because, if Santa and the Holiday Armadillo?  ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas! |6| No! Why does he have to go? 
 Do you wanna? |6| Really?! 
 And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight. |8| Yeah baby! 
 Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss. |0| Ooh. 
 Yknow what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like Its a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives. |7| Come here. I can breath through my mouth. 
 This is the best game ever!!! _B_ |9| Yeah!! 
  Really?! The |6| All right then, well have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, youll fit in well here. 
 So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man? |6| Eh!  _B_ _B_ 
 But I just wa... |4| No, but you can't. 
 She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.  |0|  They thought Joey was a child? 
 Oh really? |4| I didn't. 
 You too. |9|  Well, you have fun tonight. 
 Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer. |8| Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy. 
 I never stopped loving you. |5| Huh? 
 Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route. |5| Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade! 
  Yeah? |7| Chandler! 
 I, I know. _B_ _B_ |5| It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just... 
 Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because its, its, its not gonna be easy. |3| Ill get the hat. _B_ 
 I cant believe she cracked your code! |3| Joey! I cant believe you just did that! 
 We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked. |3|  Gin. 
 What? |4|  I'll be right back.  What was that? 
 Yeah. |6| You do? 
 She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross! |0| Dude, tell me she actually told you this. 
 Are you all right? |9| Boy, I love carrots! Oh!  Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you.  Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife  and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm,  my body.  
 Really? |5|  Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke. 
  Oh-oi-ho, yeah! |8| How good is that? 
 Oh my God! Someones killed Square Man! |7| Okay! , the coffee table forward , and taped a square outline on the floor.) 
 Listen, Im really glad you got the part. |9| Eh, better her than me! Hey, lets bake cookies! _B_ 
 Was the setting of Phoebes triumph. |8| But my apartment! 
 No! Youre the sweetest!  _B_ The |9| I love the way you look every night Chandler!  Thats why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice! 
  Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner! |5| Oh my God, you guys!!  
 Yeah. |6| You thought about that? 
 There I am! |7|  Hey! There you are! 
 Why not? |4| No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now. 
 And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy. Mr. |4| Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.  
  We need the stuff. _B_ |9| Well you can have the suite if you want. We dont care about where we stay. Were here to celebrate our love together. We dont have to get free stuff. We just want to be together. 
 Which is why you should do it. |8| Hey! Its your bachelor party. 
 Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out. |9| I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it. 
 Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn. |9| Oh! 
  What? _B_ |4| Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!? 
 I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work. |4| Well, thanks. 
 Hey. |8| Hey. 
  I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world. |2| Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.  
 What are you guys doing together? |7| Hey! 
 ....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store. |3|  That's-ah what I suspected-ah. _B_ 
 Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house. |3| This is the worst Christmas ever. 
 Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out. |7| What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up. 
 Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard youd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now! |1| Oh.  Ohh. Ohh, youre out of your mind. 
 You dont have it. |9| Doh!!  Ive got it! 
 Hi! |9| Hi Emily! 
 All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.  |9| No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just I just Kinda 
 At this?! |2| Because you're on my team! And my team always wins! 
 I need to talk to you, it's urgent! |1|  I'm Monica. 
 Yeah. |6| All right, ready? 
 Monica! This is the Men's room!  Isn't it? |9| Hi Chandler. 
 No! |2| Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no? 
 Bye! Thank God |9| Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye! 
 I dont wanna know what Monica got me. Yknow? I mean, look, Im sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about. |5| Why? 
 As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Im going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do. |1| No reason, Im just saying that uh Thats where Ill be.  _B_ 
 But then later that night |5| Oh. 
 Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya! |9| Here it comes. Our first kiss.  
 Ooh, I dont know if were there yet. _B_ |6| I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year? 
 Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Yknow Ive been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing.  Duties.  Duties!  Poo.  The |1| Absolutely.  You can relax; you did great. 
 Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this. |3| Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him. 
 Oh really!? |5| No. 
 Me too.  |9| Oh, I will. 
 I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is. |5| Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein. |8| Oh... my... 
 I didn't know you had another level. |4| It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level. 
  Takin' that with you, huh? |1| It's really not that big!  
 Yes. Yes! Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today. |9| Geez! Are you ready? 
 I think you should go back with Gary. I dont wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know Youre the reason, you are the reason why their not together. and I hated that guy. And it didnt matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad. |3| Okay. 
 Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like,  banging his hands together! |2| No, its not just cause Im jealous.  I mean Im not, Im not, Im not jealous, okay? Its Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats. 
 Okay. All right. |4| Will you stop! 
 Hey, look, what do you want from me? |4| Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal. 
 What? |4| Well, youre timing couldnt be better. Shes not my girlfriend anymore. 
 Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.  |5| Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no!  Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I... 
 Thats not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat. |5| Thats all youre basing this on? 
 I think I do!  Thank you, Monica. |9| Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey? 
 My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!  _B_ |3| Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo! 
 Hm-hmm.  |6| See? 
 Oh thats so sweet! I want to show you something too! |9| This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and its still walking distance to the kitchen. 
 But are you sure you can do this? |5|  Thank you. 
 Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself. |6| But the mess! 
  Dont try to sway her.   Im your only chance to have a baby. Okay, lets go. |0| Yeah, but Im your brother. Were family. Thats the most important thing in the world. 
 Oh my God! |4| Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own. 
 Richard! |7| Who? 
 Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy. |4| How many kids were we gonna have? 
 That was you! |7| Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm! 
 Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine. |7| Are you okay? 
 This is ridiculous.  |0| Because you sent away the dog! 
 Oh, no, no. Nina...  ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all. Mr. |0| Youre kidding? She seems so... 
 Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah? |2| Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay. 
 You do it! |9| I dont want to. You do it! 
 Okay, look, just do it gently. |7| Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don’t want to hurt her. 
 Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too. |8| Yeah.  _B_ 
 That's ok. _B_ |4| Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test... 
 So in your whole life, you've only been with oneoh. |8| With Carol?  Oh. 
 You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed. |1| Well, you know. 
 Yeah me too. |9| Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . . 
 Oh, I don't know, a million? |1| Oh my god.  How many of those have you had? 
 Really. |4| Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!!  
 I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right? |3| My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'. 
 Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!  |8| Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, dont I have to wait a while? 
 Uh-oh. _B_ |5| Ewwwww! 
 How do Monica and Phoebe know? |7| I have so got it. Theres gonna be rumours about this, theres no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know. 
 Yeah, all right. |6| All right, so well get a little coffee, and get energized, and well head back out. 
 Joey's a sex addict. |4| Thank you! 
 Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.  |1| Okay. 
  Okay. |5| Turn. 
 No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous! |1| Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you? 
 No! |2| Is this movie gonna be my big break? 
 Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place. |2| Dude, what'd you have? 
 Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I dont know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monicas face when I give her my present, and Im sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back? |1| Whatever Linus, Im opening mine. 
 Okay, so you will meet our guys? |7| All right. 
 I cant believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring! |0|  Hey. 
 I would really love it if I could do both. |6| Why dont you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnt have to apologize. 
  Hey! |8| Yeah baby! _B_ 
 Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big |7| Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share? 
 Because I'm in love with Monica!! |8| And why not?! 
 What else is new? |3| What? Are you serious?!  Joey smells gas! 
 Oh my God this doesnt count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! Theres a crazy guy out in the hall! The |2| Poo? 
 Really? Okay, so... |3| I think you're better than you think you are. 
 That sounds like fun. |6| Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi. 
 ADRIENNE TURNER!!  |9| NO! 
 I'm not supposed to tell you. |1| Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you? 
 I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right? |2| How? 
 Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing. |9| Chandler, what are you talking about? 
 Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming. |3| Whoa! You had sex today? 
  "Big guy?" |5| No? What happened, big guy? 
 Umm, this is nice. |5| Aw, God Ross. Oh. _B_ 
 Yeah, well. Its the right thing to do. |6| Wow! 
 Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.  |2| That word was swans. _B_ 
 Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth. |4| Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!  
 Oh, they said uh, You dont have insurance here, so stop calling us. |0|  Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say? 
 I am pretending. |5| I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend. 
 Oh uh, when? |3| Yeah, she broke up with me. 
 Gotcha!  |9| Oh, Ill get it.  
 Oh my God!! _B_ |5| Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! Theres a lot of theories that didnt pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry. 
 Coffee in a fight!  _B_ |6| I thought you could use the help. 
 I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me. |3| Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?! 
 All right, should we just, should we just get married? Yknow? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it. |2| All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.  
 Yknow those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?" |2| Okay! 
 Now, is that never talking about it again?! |3| Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.  
  Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!! _B_ |1| Youre right, youre right I shouldnt freak out. Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?! 
 Oh you knew that. Good! |8| What?  A-ohh!  Ohh. Oh thats right thats right. Thats Richards favorite place too. 
 Well, stuff like whered we live, yknow? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Yknow, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, wed have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old. |4| What else did you think about? 
 Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!! |3| What?! 
 And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others. Mr. |4| Thats unbelievable. 
 Did you do it on our invitations?! |4|   I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it!  "Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!"  Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh oh-oh-oh  
 All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave!  What? |3| You do it! 
 Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?! |9| Everyone at our school heard it! 
 Bye! |7| Bye! 
 Bye! |7| Bye! 
 Yeah, just second.  Good-bye Mr. Heckles.  We'll try to keep it down. Ending Credits _B_ |5| You comin'? 
 And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on. |5|  Uh-huh. 
 Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . . |8| I know. Yeah. 
 I'm fine. |6| Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la. 
 Ross, dont. Ross! Monica; Ross! _B_ |9| Were kidding! 
  Go on. |0| Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous  or very  stingy. 
 Ahh, come on! Yknow whatyknow what, I think Im just gonna go home and call Kathy. |2| Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy. 
 What was that? |2|  Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!  
 Okay, bye!  Oh my God!! |5| Oh, great! 
  Monica |0| Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?! 
 Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore! |1| Turn! Turn!  
 Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?! |1| Come on, we can't let them win! 
 Yes. |6|  What?! 
 That's perfect! That's brilliant!  |9|  The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures. 
  Yeah, this is so good, that Im gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert. _B_ Mrs. |9|  Mmm. 
 Fine!  |8| Will you get us better gifts? 
 Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve. |1| Okay, Chandler, you go first. 
 Okay now it doesnt matter which one you choose, yknow? Its completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself. |6| Yes, Ill meet em. 
 Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe?   Hello?  Damnit!  Hello?  No, Joeys not here right now, but I can take a message I think.  Hes still got a chance for the part?! Oh, thats great news!  Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog.  Oh well, thats great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you!  Yes!  Okay, Mac audition at 200. Allergy actor attacked.  By dog not flowers. _B_ |3| Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.  _B_ _B_ _B_ _B_ _B_ _B_ 
 No, its not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monicas face when I gave it to her, yknow? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye.  Look, this is the most important thing Im gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure its perfect. |5| Its not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! Its a beautiful ring! 
 What? |4| All right, I I have to ask. 
 Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away. |1|  Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food!  What's the matter? 
 What? |4| Oh man! 
 Well I was I wasn't exactly expecting company after  915. |0|  Cute PJs! Youre really livin it up here in London huh? 
 Kinda. Theyre really big. |3| Youre wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all? 
 Love her! That's right, I LOVE HER!!! I love her!!  I love you, Monica. |9| You're-you're what?!  
  Chandler.  |8| So whats your name? 
 Ill look forward to your call.  _B_ |6| Poo?! 
 Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay? |2|  Know when to stop. 
 Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong? |0|  Hey. Where's Joey? 
 It's over/Joe! |0| Mmmm hmm! For your boob job! Monica, Rachel, 
 Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!  |5| Don’t blame the questions! 
 You told us both we could be in the wedding?  |6| I'm not supposed to tell you!  
 Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm! _B_ |9| Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting. 
  Obviously. |4| I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us. 
 Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.  |2| Wow! 
 You still can't stand her can you? |4| I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.  
  Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay.  Okay, what do I do? |3| You know what, everything's gonna be okay.  
 Okay, on three. One....Two.... |4| Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be. _B_ 
 No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton? |0| I know, it is isnt it? 
 Then dont leave me! |4| Oh! Youre right. Oh God. But, before I can say good-bye, theres something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, its like, I finally understand what Lionel Richies been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, its like movie love, youre my soulmate, and I cant believe were not going to be spending the rest of our lives together. 
 Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got.  See, she's fully dressed, right? |1| So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night? 
 Why? What happened to him? |0| Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny. 
 Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?  No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!! |4| Well then, do it better! 
 Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay? |0| Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, thats why I let people watch. 
 Sorry! |4| That doesnt sound like thinking to me! 
 Thanks man. |9| No, 19. 
 Me too! |9| Im sick of the signs! Its too fast, Im happy the way things are! 
 Yknow? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, thats you and I together! Merge! |5| Uh-hmm. 
  Ahh, third base. |6| My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie. 
 Sure you do. |7|  Yknow what? I-I dont want a big, fancy wedding. 
 I dont know, but dont worry, dont worry, because I know how to take a picture now.  Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down  |7| Chandler, what were you thinking? 
 Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.  _B_ Soothing male |4| I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head. 
 Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!  |5| Yes. Yes. Just here  and there . _B_ 
 So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed!   |7|  Not on the ones we sent out. 
 Y'know, I've had dates like this. |1| Let me see! Show them! 
 I dont think weve actually done this before! |4| I miss this. 
 Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that...  what happens to cranberry sauce? |8| No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy. 
 Sure.  My god, that's a big head! It didn't look this big in the office. Maybe it's the lighting. My head must look like a golf ball at work. All right, don't get hung up on it, quick, quick, list five things you like about |2| Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted?" 
 I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all. |0| Well no, but um. 
 Alright, we're gettin' closer. |6| Mailbox. 
 So I got ya something. _B_ |5| No, we're alright. 
 I'm not fine. Here she comes. |4| All right.  
 No, Beth doesnt die, she doesnt die. Does she Rachel? |0| Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die? 
 And Milton Berle has a |9| I can make you a legend. I can make you this generations Milton Berle. 
 No! That was a test! In a couple of hours Im gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, Im gonna get so drunk, Im gonna wanna call Janice |2| Well, if you think it will help. 
 Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?  |9| Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a... 
 Oh yeah, there-there she is! |9| She's there?! 
 Will you marry me?  |8| No-no, don't-don't-don't do it! 
  So? |5| Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase! 
 I also said, "Yes!" |7| Dude you said, "No!" 
 Thats what you got me? |5| Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier? 
 Can I finish my story?! |3| Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas? 
 Please tell me you got the message! |5| Hey! 
 I cant do that. |0| Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something. 
 What?! |3| Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again? 
 Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me? |1| So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero. 
 Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bridesmaid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, youre not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya? |3|  Is Joey here? 
 What? |4| Doesnt it ever just freak you out that-that youre never gonna be with anybody new again? 
 Oh, theyre a hoot. |7| Chandler? What an unusual name! You mustve had terribly fascinating parents. 
 I would never lie to get someone into bed. |1| Well, we had a little fight. 
 Right! _B_ _B_ |6| Yeah.  Don't do the dance. 
  You are really frightening me.  |7| Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station. 
  Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!  |7| Chandler!!! Chandler!!!  Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here! 
 Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her. |4| I never did anything with Adrienne Turner. 
 Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away. |3| But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't think we should get this house now. 
 Have fun at church-camp!  |8| Okay. 
 Have fun at church-camp!  |8| Okay. 
 I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again. |4| Still doing the screening thing? 
 Kick save and... denied. |2| I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does." _B_ 
 Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot. |7| I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did. 
 Why two? |0| Why dont we just go on two. 
 Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device. |5| Yeah! And I got it on sale, too. 
 Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me! |5| What? 
 Its like Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.  |9| You saved them! You guys! Oh God, youre the best! 
 And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and  whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!  |4| Right. 
 Yeah, never cheat on Rachel. _B_ |4| Should we do something? 
 Yes, but I-I uh, dont have too. |9| Well, Ive been better. But, Im all right. So you like her huh? 
 Okay, okay, you got it! |9| Yknow I dont think you should be talking at all in there! I think youve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes! 
 A place where no one will ever get out alive? |5| Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what Ive got? 
  Hey! |8|   Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something. _B_ 
 Yes that was a nice place! |3| Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet! 
 Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!  |0| Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot!  Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et! 
 Really? |5| Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat. 
 No! |2| I dont want things to change! Do you? 
 Really?! |5| Oh my God! I love that! 
 You sure? |6| No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage. 
  Yeah!  _B_ |8| Chandler? 
 Are you eating the cheesecake without me?! |6| Oh, youre such a gentleman.  Come on! Were going to my place!  _B_ 
 Well we we still hang out. |6| No, I-I miss hanging out with you. 
 One more score to go! You can do it!  |9| I know! 
 Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show theyre not in the baby buying business. |4| Its all gonna be okay. Theyre just so happy that Im not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear. 
 Oh my God, introduce us! |5| Oh my God, Rachel!  
 Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple? Dr. |3|  You are really frightening me.  
  Oh thank God! _B_ |8|  Nothing. It's fine. 
 Rach, Rach, knock knock. |5| Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.  
 Relax! We just get her some antacids. |2| Oh my God! 
 So, you feel like goin' for a run? |5| Y'know, I try to stay positive. . . 
 Lick away my man. |6| Plastic spoons. Great. 
 How do you do that? |4| Wait here. Breathe.  
 Actually, me too. |9| Im kinda beat. 
 Ohhh!! |7| You should! How is she? 
 I don't believe they're brother and sister. |4| Yeah, wow, sorry Rach. 
  All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?! |1| What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now! _B_ 
 Phoebe. |6| Oh now, don't give away the farm!  
 Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about? |6| I feel really sad that we're not really there anymore. 
 No!  Ahhh!!! |2| You don't think this is going to be a big break for me? 
 The actor playing Mac couldnt do it, they needed to see you at 2 oclock. |1| What message? 
 A hundred and forty-five pounds. |4| Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained? 
 And that doesn't scare you?  |3| Chandler, it's like a big gerbil. 
 Well, look its been a really emotional time yknow, and youve had a lot to drink. And youve just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight! |7| Wouldnt you be? 
  What are you guys talking about? |6| Phoebe, hes gotta be in the room for that to work. 
 No. No, see when I first meet somebody its uh its mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating. |6| Just, I love you so much. Just Its just sometimes it bothers me that Im never gonna have that feeling. Yknow when you meet someone for the first time and its new and exciting? Yknow that rush? 
 Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father. |1|  Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.  _B_ 
 I suppose that Monica will have the ... manipulative shrew. |4| You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn't it? How d'you get a biggertable? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shutup Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck. 
 Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new. |1| I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue. 
  Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now. |8|  There y'go. 
 All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating. |0| Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair.  You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once? 
 Really? _B_ Present Chandler's |9| I don't know what... you're talking about. 
 I understand. |6| Chandler, one of us has got to be strong. 
 I know! You ready to trade? |6| Oh, look at these little bunnies! 
 I know! You ready to trade? |6| Oh, look at these little bunnies! 
 What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre? SECURITY |0| This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year. 
 Well, I guess that's something. |1| But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium. 
 Hello! |7| Yeah. 
 Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this two talk. |0| Because its faster. 
 Oh yeah, that sounds great.  Oh, and listen, its, its gonna be.... |7| Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can. 
 No you dont! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance. |1| No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-Ive got to give my marriage another chance. 
 Sure, everybody loves a kidder. |9|  Hello?  Yeah, this is she.  Oh! Youre kidding! Youre kidding!  Oh thank you! I love you! 
 Where ya going? |9| Yeah, well, dont Aww Pheebs, that sucks! me yet.  
 To pay for the gym.  |3| What are you ever gonna use that for?! 
 Yeah? |7| No-no-no, no its uh, its okay. 
 Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare. |0| Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips. 
 I just came over to drop off nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh? |1| Hi. 
 Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag! |7| Yeah! 
 Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep.  |0| Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry. 
  Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary. |2| Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right 
 Jeez, relax! Its not like were mar-ah-ah!!  |5| All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because its been three days and its driving me insane! 
 Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe! |8|  Chandler, I think Im sick. 
 Okay and he hasnt proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger. |1| There he is!  
 I love you so much. |9| Uh-hmm. 
 I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now.  How can you eat the cheesecake without me?! |3|  Mm-mmm.  
 Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet. _B_ |1| Well actually, Ross doesn't. 
 Well yknow, things are different. Im Im married now. |7| Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Yknow now its like things are different. 
 Oh Im sorry, youre kicking me out of my own living room? |4| Chandler, can you give us a minute? 
 I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy. |1| I have a ring. 
 I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy. |1| I have a ring. 
  That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand. |3| Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down. 
 I'll tell you at the wedding. |6| Who's there? 
 Oh my God! |4| She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor. 
  Bob here. |0| Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy. 
 Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here. |4| All right. 
 What? |4| These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones. 
 We should always always break up together. |7| It's like a gift. 
 Something so sweet and...disturbing about that. |8| My mom will. 
 Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen. |1| Hello. 
  Well hello! |9| Okay.  Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell. Thats all I have so far. Closing Credits _B_ 
  Oh my God!  |4| Oh my God! The millionaires here! 
 Hey. |8| To pay for the gym.  
 Now this feels like Thanksgiving. _B_ |6| Stop it, stop it, stop it! 
 But we're not ready to tell yet! |1| Sorry! I'm justI'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel! 
 Come on in. |5| Chandler. 
 Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now. |5| Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time? 
 Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high. |2| I don't believe this! 
  Yknow I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here? |0| Jeez, relax! Its not like were mar-ah-ah!!  
 So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steves doctors name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, Doctor Monkey? And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.  |3| Continue. 
 Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Rosss! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches! |3| What?! Its 6 oclock! 
 Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15! |1| In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! Thats not the point. 
 You kidding? Youre the most beautiful woman in most rooms   Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whats going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out? |7| Really? 
 Sleeping with somebody |3| Okay, but all right youre a guy, does it not freak you that youre never gonna sleep with anybody else? 
 Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this. |8| Uh-huh. 
 All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!! |3| Dont touch her!! 
 Let's go!  |6| You're so efficient. I love you! 
 No, no, no. |1| Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.  
 Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica. |8|  Hey, what's-what's going on?! 
  They're never coming down now. _B_ |3| Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness...  Goodbye Chandler Bing.  
 Okay. |5| Okay. 
 Okay. |5| Okay. 
  Hey, he's not crying.  |4| Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy.  Hey, he's not crying. 
 Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's. |4| Well, we had a table in college. 
 Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going? MR. |7| I'm getting ready for the water skiing. _B_ How are you doing? 
 Okay. |5| No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway. 
 Ohhh. Dont go. |4|  Im sorry.  
 Multiple, so many paper cuts. |2|  Call her! Call her now! 
 Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do. |5| Yeah. You know why? Cause you came to me first. 
 Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!  |7| Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something? 
 So, I guess this is over. |1| Yeah, it did. 
 What are we gonna do? |4| Yeah!  
 What? The |3| You brought a carrot. 
 I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this. |0| Chandler, why are you doing this? 
 Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now. |0| All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.  
 Whoa! |7| All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today. 
 No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way. |2| Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?  
 Who sold a story to Archie Comics?! |6|  I love that idea! _B_ 
  Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say? |2| Okay.  
 Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him. |9| Wow! Youre good! After this, we should solve crimes. 
 Oh yeah, totally! |6| I love you.  Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right. 
 Yknow what? I dont trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and Im takin it back!  |2| Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are dessert stealers! We are living outside the law! 
 But I love swing music! |9| Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now Im not saying that theres any connection here yknow, but they did tell me thats why they got divorced. 
 Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on well make time to hang out with each other. |7| Oh sureAnd hey, dont get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just I miss hanging out just-just us, yknow? 
 Ill be in there.  |5| Yeah. 
 So, uh, you met someone, huh? |5| Oh, hi. 
 Okay.  End|1| Okay. Just for a little while. 
 Well, so why not go knock? |0| Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter. 
 No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place? |1| Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment. 
 What are you, stop naming dwarves!  Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry.  Really?!  Really?! |1| Yes, and grumpy. 
 The doctor. |0| Where have you been? 
 Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything. |4| Guys, please, Im just gonna have dinner with him. Okay? 
 Well let's .let's see what everybody thinks of that? |8|  I slept with Monica. 
 Sure.  |6| I was going too.  Umm, I brought some wine. Would you like some? 
 Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.  |8| Really? 
 They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie! |1| What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie! 
 Well, what if all my stuff was here? |1| Then all your stuff would be here. 
 Whats wrong? |0| Hey! 
 Im not arguing with that. |0| Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, Im a doctor, and I had a monkey. Im Doctor Monkey! 
 Sorry! I-I-I dont know what to say. |2| I cant believe this Chandler! 
 Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different. |1| Well Thats not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat. 
 But we dont do that. |0| Well, not anymore. 
 You know, you think I would.  |1| Do you have a point? 
 Actually Monica and I are engaged. |7| Im not very fond of New York. Queens I like.  Ooh, what is this sparkle something!  Honey! Huh? 
 Hey! |8| Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like...  
 Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve. |3| No-no-no, wait! We need something old! 
 I think she looks cute.  ... but I am wrong! |2| Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it? 
 Honey, it's gonna be okay. |3| All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!  
 We could trade later. |6| Alright, let's see..  
 We could trade later. |6| Alright, let's see..  
 Oh God! |2| Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross. 
 No. No! No! No! |0| No, I-I-I gotta go.  
  Oh, well give me the phone then. |2| Why hasnt he called Rachel? Why? Why? I dont understand. Why? He said hell call. Why? Why? Chandler Im telling you she has flipped out, shes gone crazy! 
 See uh, thats-thats actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is. |1| But hey, listen just so you know, you might have youre work cut out for you. Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that shes into some other guy. So 
  And then the peacock bit me.  Please kiss me at midnight.  |7| There y'go, kids. 
 That's very funny. We done now? |7|  We're rehearsing a Greek play. 
 Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime. |4| What? 
 About Ross! |7| I don't know. Maybe pizza? 
 I'm doing this because I'm sorry? |1| Chandler. 
 Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!  |7| Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000! 
 No-no-no-no-no! |3| Come on! I really need your help! 
 Aww. |4| Oh my God! Thats great! Oh wow!  Youre a published writer! I wish I had a present for you! 
 For camp! |1| Shes leaving for three months. 
 Oh yes! |9| What?! What?! 
 Hey! |8| Hey Chandler! 
 Okay, here we go. |4|  Lift!! And slide! 
 Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And theres another reason too. |6| Yeah but the Swing Kings? Yknow they suck so much that people actually die at their concertsThey just stop living. 
 I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship.  Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives. |8| Even with me? 
 What's up with the simian? |4| You know, you think I would.  
 You mean the lully story? |8| Y'guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to thebeauty salon? 
 Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her. |1|  I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this! 
 So, uh, how was he? |3| Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.  
 Well I didn't think that was serious. _B_ Ya know I thought that was just a fight. |2| I'm movin' out like we talked about. 
  I love you too. |9| He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now. 
  Should I tell her I ordered tea? |4| Here we go. Im serving my last cup of coffee.  There you go.  Enjoy.  
 Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting. |8| Is everything okay? 
 Okay, then get the lobster! |4| I know!! 
 Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift? |5| Hey! 
 You cant tell, but Im trying to break the tension by mooning you guys! |3| Okay, fine.   
 Me? No. You? |4| So, here we are. Nervous? 
 Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot? _B_ |1| I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch! 
 Yeah? |7| That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way. 
 Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break. |3| Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break. 
 Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what Im saying? |5| Then youd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesnt make any sense. 
 Wh-How did you lose at Cups?! |3| Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups! 
 I am so, so, so, so sorry! |1| Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldnt. Thats why Im here. Maybe we could attack them together?  That-thats a no. _B_ 
 You know the hotels? |6| Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona? 
  Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here! |2| Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!! 
 You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back! |2| How? 
 How drunk are you? |6| I know, I just thought it would be fun. 
 What are you guys talking about? |6| Heeeyy! Hey! 
 I don't think so. |0| That'll work! 
 Sorry, we're on a major flan high. |1|Alright, alright, I can get my own coat. _B_ 
 Really? |5| Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too. 
 Okay, one...two... |3| Heavy thing, not getting lighter! 
 I dont care!  I dont care!! |5| Honey, honey, people are looking. 
 Look, you cant call somebody after this long just to say, In case you didnt notice, I dont like you! |1| Come on, this isnt funny. She thinks its my fault that you havent called her. You have to call her! 
 Its me. Im the other guy. |4| Who? 
 Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud? |1| Yeah, me too. 
 Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you. |6| You seen Sandy? 
 That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her. |0| No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel? 
 Because of the weekend, we had a fight. |2| Why, exactly? 
 No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.  Will you be my wife? |5| Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry? 
 Good luck! |8| Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again! 
  Yes, but if its any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it. _B_ |1| ...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street? _B_ 
 Okay.  |5| Fine, Ill rub it on myself. 
 You wanna share it? |7| Wait a minute!  My last Kit-Kat bar!  
 Oh yes! |9| Wait a minute! 
 Yeah, Id love to but Ive tried that so many times they wont even let me in the store anymore. |1| How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest? 
 I dont want to say. |3| Well, what is the other reason? 
 Well yeah! But now that I know that youre having these thoughts, Im back to panic, anxiety, and uh Im definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink. |5| Really? 
 Okay...  ..whose turn is it? |3| It's just a fur ball. 
 What? Why? |1| Unless you name your firstborn child Joey. 
 Eh? |7| Eh.  
 You, you are gonna love this. |9| Ohhh. Big boy, riding the busHey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt? 
 Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges. |6| Yeah? 
 Well, there you go. |6| Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever. 
 We're worried about you. |6| Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you. 
 See, that's why we don't let her play. |7| _B_ Score! Now can we go? 
 Oh yeah? That's great! |9| Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now. 
 Youre right, and Im sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I wont say another word tonight. |3| All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesnt mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise youre just an idiot in a box! 
  Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night.  Well, who doesn't love dogs?  Ah, he's a tap dancer!  Yes, some would say that is a lost art.  He's a pimp!  There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp!  Hello?  |4| Hello!  Oh yeah!  It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references.  Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable. 
 Hey man, how did the audition go? |5| Hey! 
 So do I.  |6| No, I want this to happen. 
 Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship. |5| Yeah.  
 Oh, you don't want me on the trip? |4| Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone. 
 Me asking is kind of a sign. |3| Live together? There have been no signs for that. 
 Oh man!! |4| The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didnt even get half a cup! Nothin!! 
 Is not. _B_ |2| Its your joke. 
 So youre just, kinda rubbing it on yourself? |7| Okay.  
 And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!  |8|  Uh-huh. 
 Yknow, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean! |2| Oh, well Im uh 
 Look you have to realize I dont think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.  See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is youre Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica. |6| What if I have babies, okay? I mean Im gonna look different. Im okay with that, but Im not sure that you are! 
  Thats the perfect amount! |9| Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage. 
 Wait! Wait! Wed really love it if you could be there. |9|  I see. Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness.  So youre bald? 
 You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?  |7| Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.  
  Here just...take this.  |8| Okay, now we just need something borrowed! 
 Hey. Agency |7| Hey. 
 You cant leave! I have your shoe! |6| Yeah, um, Im, Im leaving now.  
 No-no-no-no, the games not over, were just switching teams. |4|  The game is over, we eat now? 
 Nooo!! Shes really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye! |0| Well then youre going to have to take her out again. 
 Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and |5| What? 
 Shall I carve? |6| It's nice that he has someone. _B_ 
 So, this isn't over? |3| Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh!  
 Ohhhhh!  _B_ |8|  Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night.  Well, who doesn't love dogs?  Ah, he's a tap dancer!  Yes, some would say that is a lost art.  He's a pimp!  There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp!  Hello?  
 Without my toe?! I need my toe! |1| It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound. 
 I'm gonna put on some music. |6| So do I.  
 Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now. |0|  Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds. 
 I see.  Commercial Break _B_ |9| Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through! 
 We said seven! |3| Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six. 
 No, no he went for a walk. |3|  Hey, is Chandler here? 
 Oh yes! Oh yes! |9| Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you dont! _B_ 
  Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year? |2| Well what if I told you you can do it in my apartment? 
 Well its just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was the first time I knew that you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with. |6| Well you have to because maybe its stupid. 
  Water! Water! Water! _B_ |8| Come here! Come here!  Sweetie you dont have to worry. No, besides yknow what? Im gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid 
 No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'. |0| Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'. 
 You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse.  |1| You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?  
 Your family name is Tribbiani. |9| Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name. 
 Hi Ross. |8| Hey guys. Monica and 
 Well, that makes me feel so good. |8| Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name. 
  Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run! Closing Credits _B_ |8|  Will you hold Ben for a sec?  Come here. Come here. 
 Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there. |1| Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry. 
 Oh, good job Joe. |9| All right!!  
 This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela? Joeys |8|  You grow up. _B_ 
 That was an obvious joke, and I didnt think of it. Why didnt I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done! End|0| Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke! 
 _B_ Aahhuuhhh.... _B_ |6| Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this! 
 Absolutely! |8| So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously? 
 Those were like the best seats ever. |7| It was.  Commerical Break _B_ 
  Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like? |6| Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.  
 Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out! |9| Did not.

 Okay!!!!!  |5| YES!!!!!!!! 
 All right, lets play one more hand! One more! |5| And he never played before either! Yknow what I think? I think beginners luck, very important in Cups. 
 Hi, oh hi. |8| Hi, Chandler. There you are.

 Aren't you...? |6| Well let's see. Maybe he knows where Ross is.  Hey, how's it going  . 
 What? |4| Chandler, wait, wait, wait... 
 Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit? |4| Seven hundred bucks! 
 Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out. |7| You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping. 
 Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball? |8| Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels. _B_ 
 Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn? |2| I gotta get going. Bye Chandler. 
 All right! Fine! But its just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I dont want you setting me up with anybody ever again! |7| I dont care! I dont care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows its actually ended. And, I dont care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again! 
 Yeah Bunny-rabbit. |9| Hey Duck, is Chick here? 
 No! No! No! I just kissed her. |0| And what?! Did you sleep with her?! 
 Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese? |6| By all means. 
 Really? Okay. Great! |9|  You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about. 
 You look good. |9| Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you.  
 Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.  |2| Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now! 
 Okay, hold on.  Okay.  |2|  Oh, mine! Mine! Mine!  Okay, here goes. Prepare yourselves for some Class A flirting. 
 The only way that I said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six. |1| We said six! 
  Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring youre about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, Im gonna need to have that back.  But, in exchange Im willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring.  Ew. |1|  Here he is. 
 Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if youre not careful you may not get married at all this year! _B_ |3| Ive got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part. 
 Well thats not fair, youve already had some! |2| You think I trust you with it?! No! Were gonna split it! You take half and I take half! 
 Thats awesome! Thats great! What made you do it?! |9| I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.  
 What? |4|  Yknow whats weird? 
 That means nothing to me.  Come on! _B_ |0|  Look honey, you dont have to do this, okay? Its the strength you have inside that means the most to me. Youre loyal, youre honest, and you have integrity! Thats the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love! 
 If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza.  |6| Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister! 
 Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky. |4| Hey hey, can I help? 
 I did pay for half of it. |4| Woah. Why do you get to keep the table? 
 Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time. |1| Uh-oh. 
 Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller! |3| Wow, its big! 
 No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from? |0| Right. Okay, lets play. Lets go. 
 Well, its, its yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it? Joeys |9| No! I did! 
 Yknow what? Were not sad, were not sad, were just not 21 anymore. Yknow? Im 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour! Joey and |2| Yeah, I know. 
 And the moment of joy is upon us. |9|  In twenty seconds it'll be midnight... 
 Oh yeah, thats very nice. Plus, yknow they were free and theyre too small.  |2| Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Yknow, kinda like a peace offering. 
 That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?! |0| Oh, I'm not falling for that one! Present Day _B_ 
 Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up!   And now we're back. Ending Credits _B_ _B_ |2| Okay, I freaked out a little. 
 All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now! |9| Yeah! I don't want you on the trip! 
 Okay. |5| Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait! 
 I cant take the big white dog! You love it! |9| No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! Im serious this time! In-in fact, look, theres aI wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money.  Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, yknow, thank you for being such a great roommate. 
  Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady.  Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail andgenerosity of spirit. |7| Hey, its Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why dont you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?  
 Yes!  |8| Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on? 
 Whats this? |3| Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say Im sorry. Here.  
 Okay.  Janices |0| Okay. 
 Oh, we could do this all day. |3|  Thats mean! You really had me going there! 
 Id carry you around in my pocket. |8| Even if I shrink down to two inches tall? 
 I would but mine doesnt fit. The pants are a little tight. |4| Gunther.  Hey-hey! Why dont we put them on? Yknow get a picture of Batman and James Bond together. 
 Okay, one thing at a time.  _B_ _B_ |4| Ohh.  
 Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him. |3| Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us. 
 Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it.  _B_  |7| Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry. 
  Right.  So how're you doing? |9| Yeah, Rachel. And this  is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving.  . 
 Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing? |6| Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something. 
 Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it. |5|  Bumpy? 
 Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here! |0| Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas. _B_ 
 _B_ Yeah o-, OK, alright. _B_ Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch. |1| No thanks man, I'm not uh, I'm not really into sports. 
 We came over as soon as we saw. |7| Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks. 
 OK. |5| Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy. 
 Thats just a lot of big talk, y'know. |4| Thats fine! 
 Ohh, thats a good one.  _B_ |6| Ooh, I dont know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass. 
 Hey! Happy birthday. |9| Hey! 
 How is that worse?! |0| What?!! Thats even worse!! 
 Oh. Oh, God!  |0| Oh yeah, thats very nice. Plus, yknow they were free and theyre too small.  
  We're in a relationship? |5| Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!  
 Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom? |3| Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off! 
  Why to save your dignity my man. |2| Uh, Rachel, Ive been thinking. I dont think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. Im calling it off. 
 What do we use to split it? |4| What? Oh, well then yknow what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy. 
 Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joeys chair? |2| Well, its a long story, but umm I broke Joeys chair 
 I know. |5| This doesnt feel weird! 
 Yeah. Thanks for making me do this. |9|  You okay? 
 Im leaning. This is where I lean. |9|  What are you doing? 
 What is so funny about that?  |4| Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!  
 Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it. |4| Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half. 
 And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right? |9| Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania. 
 Im an alien. Im an alien. |7|  Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight...  Okay, Blast off!  
 So um, Mary-Angela, whats your second favorite? Joeys |9| Of course! Its her favorite. 
 You cant just call Monicas room. |4| I call Monicas room! 
 That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?! |0| I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident. 
 Oh my God! |4| Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag! 
 You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge. |1| Fine!  Get out! 
 Oh thanks. |9| Heres your key  
 No, but waitwhat if I bought it from you, yknow? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say  $1,500? |3| Its him, not it! 
 Its all very, very good.  So you wanna go uh, mix it up? |4| I cant believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell? 
 Aww, thanks man.  |9| Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it. 
 So, are we going in there? |8|  My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine! You make me high over my heart!  
 You are gonna be a huge star! Im gonna hug ya! |4| Yeah, youre right. Okay look, listen, lets talk about what a huge star Im gonna be! 
 Oh my good God. |4|  Hi! 
 No-no! This is my fiancee  and her heart was set on that ring. You dont want to break her heart now do you? |6| It is beautiful, but Im gonna use this one. Now, if youll excuse me. 
 Skidmarks still got a way with the ladies. _B_ |8| I love you.  
 You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.  |3| Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid? 
 Who are those people? |5| Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now? 
 Ehh. |3| Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that. 
 Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat? |1| Because there are so many terrible sights in this world. 
 The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor. |3| I don't understand. 
 Hi Monica. |9| Bitchin' 
 You don't like that show? |4| Y-, y-, you like that show? 
 Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun. |8| Ok everybody, it's time for flan. 
 Look, Im sorry! But theres nothing I can do, I think Im in love with her! |1| I dont know! But its the same! 
 I KNOW!!!  |4| Hey, want a beer?   WHOA!!!! 
 Okay.  _B_ |5| I'm afraid so. 
 Oh, do you not want to? |4| Really? 
  You guys ready fore the movies? |8| Thank God! I can't watch him anymore! 
 Im sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why dont you uh, lift up your shirt?  Take a look at this kiddo.  We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras! _B_ |1| Cut!!!!!!!!!!   
 Well, maybe you dont marry this one. _B_ |3| Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys? 
  Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh Theres more crust on this side. Yknow? So, maybe if I measured |0| Okay!  All right, pick a half. 
 I thought I broke Joeys chair! Thats why I replaced it with mine! |1| Yeah. 
 Well, I have kissed over four women.  Do you wanna get under the covers? |3| Youre a really good kisser. 
 Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile. |6| What's goin' on?  
 Well, does that mean that youre not going to be wearing yours? |2| Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together. 
 Call. |4| I'm in for fifty cents.  
 Okay.  |5| I think we found a place. 
 Did you tell her what we talked about?  |5| Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy!  
 Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day. |1|  BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright? _B_ 
 Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day. |1|  BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright? _B_ 
 Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?  |3| Still, he had to find out sometime. 
 HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts! |9| That's worse than no food. _B_  
 Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister. |6| Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass. 
 Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?  |4| Look its not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door. 
 Would you just please....give me the receipt cause this is great. Its top notch. Joeys |8| More of Grandmas teramisu. 
 Cause its-its not his last name. |3|  Hey!  Why isnt it Spiderman? Yknow like Goldman, Silverman... 
 Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, wed really appreciate it.  |9| Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And youre welcome to come back anytime. 
 No he didn't. _B_ |0| You know, uh... _B_ Chandler got you a gift, too. 
 Are we in London? |6| Oh, that is better. _B_ 
 Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.  |4| Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!  
 Open up! Open up! Open up!  |5| I KNOW!!!  
 Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.  |6| I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe! 
 Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict? |8| My God Monica!! 
 All right!!  Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here. Commercial Break _B_ |2| Get out!! 
 The door hasnt been locked in five years, but okay!  Ready?! |3| Heres your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in! 
 When did I try to give you money? |0| Wait a second, I see what youre trying to do here! You-youre trying to give me money again! 
  Im out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again? |2| Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler. 
 Oh come on you big faker! |1| Not now, Im sick! 
 All right! _B_ _B_ |5| You hug me! 
 Please, please, please, don't be mad at me. |2| Hi, honey. 
 Thats the magic story you use when you wanna have sex! |5| You used the Europe story! 
 Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go. |7| The Police? Here? A reunion?!  _B_ 
 Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding. |0| Eh, you work for that. 
 Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock. |7| Loved your Stevie Wonder last night. 
 I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident. |3| Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?  
 O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross.  |2| Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you  NOT.  
 So, let's go.  |5| Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here. 
 I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic... |9| Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman? 
 Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running. |6| Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know. 
 _B_ Ding dong, the psycho's gone. |1| Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck. 
 Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about. |6| Oh, that is so sweet. I think Im falling in love with you all over again. _B_ 
  Hello. Joey, Rachel, and |9| That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, dont bite your nails. _B_ 
 Youre right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line. |1| Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you! 
  Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion. _B_ |5| No. No! It's just y'know first, I wanna take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me. 
 I didn't think I was!  |2| Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that. 
 Hey. |8| Yeah. _B_ 
 Oh you wouldnt uh, care. Its just a stupid comic book story. |0| Oh my God! Thats great! Congratulations! Whats the story?! 
 What?! |3| I know what time you said. 
 Yeah, shes dying Of a cough apparently. |0| Youre dying?!  
 All right, Ill pick that one.  |3| Oh for God sake just pick a piece! 
 Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it? |3| Ohhhhh. Thats how it got fixed! 
 Okay!  |7| Hm-hmm! 
  Let me try it on! |5| What, are you kidding? Its Batmans tux!! 
 Hey Bobby. |9| Hey Toby! 
 Okay. Uh, well dim the lights, dim the lights.  Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go.  |3| Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little? 
 So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS?  |1| Yeah.... 
 Please let me stay on this side of the door. _B_ |3| Stinky?! 
 I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like. Agency |5| That's impossible. 
 _B_ So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid. DIRECTOR'S |4| Woah. 
 No. |4| Oh yeah. 
 So will I. Joeys |6| That dies with me. 
 We cant tell him, you cant go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff. |3| Please, right now, no, every time I see him its like Is it on the lose? Is it watching me? 
 No, its not like, like Phil Spiderman. Hes a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but theres no Gold Man. |1| It isnt? 
 Happy birthday! I'm sorry. |7| Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho! 
  Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John? |0| Drum roll. 
 What the hell is going on?!  |1| Well discuss it, in the morning!  
 Man, she is really gullible.  _B_ |1| 'Kay.  Congratulations on your new job.   
 Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her! |1|  Well that would be nice. I'll go get the lotion. _B_ 
 Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I cant get in! |1| Ready!  
 Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain. |6| Wow. 
 Im just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that youre okay. |7| Over there!  Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again! 
  Youre a little high maintenance. |5| Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler! 
 Well that was before all the vaporizing action. |3| What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people? 
 I think so. Yeah, get off me. |2| Hey, do we do this too much? 
 Well, somebody should.  _B_ |3|  I cant believe youre gonna have sex on my engagement night!! 
  When I was growing up I played the one on the far left. _B_ |5| Amen! 
 Oh Im sorry! Do you need a break? |1|  Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! 
 Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do. |4| You do?! 
 I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!  |8|  Open your drapes! Open your drapes! 
 I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!  |8|  Open your drapes! Open your drapes! 
 Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now. |1| Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song. 
 No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..  |0| Really? 
 Oh o-, OK man. _B_ _B_ _B_ _B_ CLOSING CREDITS _B_ |1| I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while. 
 Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD! |4| Are you sure this time? 
 Fine with me. |6| Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-Im not playing with this guy, now. 
 Man, I gotta get a kid.  |4| You have a play date with a stripper?! 
 Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me! |1| Over the line?! You-youre-youre so far past the line, that you-you cant even see the line! The line is a dot to you! 
 I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked. |4| The bigger half. 
 Oh, I would never bet this apartment. Its too nice. |2| Yeah.  I bet you cant guess what color my tonsils are? Ill bet the apartment! 
 Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.  Ending Credits _B_ |4| Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes? 
 Ooh, I do! I do! I do!  |9|  All right! Hey, who wants pizza?! 
 Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesnt want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assistas his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that cant have lumps in them. |2| Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang! 
  Okay, thats enough honey! |4| Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if Im not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity 
 Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Yknow, for you, and  I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.  |7|  Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't. 
  Ohhh! |7| Thats also the smaller piece.  Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and dont come crying to me if you eat your piece too fast.  Oh!!!! 
 Im gettin my chair back!  |4| Noo!  Angels. 
 It bodes well for me that speed impresses you. |9| Wow! You are really fast! 
  Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman!  Whats this? |4| Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin in there. 
 Uhh yeah. Yeah, its  right, right down there.  Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why? |2| Its Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler Bings office is? 
 Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me? |8| Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey. 
 You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache? |3| No problem.  
 Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not. |1| Rachel and Joey's. Joey's home alone, reading a Sports Illustrated magazine when Chandler enters.] 
  Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner? |2| Good luck!  
 Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal. |6| Nooooo. 
 Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesnt mean anything. Joeys |0| Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom. 
  Wax the door shut, were never leaving, ever. _B_ |1| Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to. _B_ 
 Oh no, now its not gonna make any sense! |0| Arrrghh!! 
  I love you.  |9|  Hello, Chandler.  
 See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock. |8| You really didn't have to.  Wow. 
 All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 330 I am going down to the courthouse. |0| Nah, youre not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney. 
 I can't believe this. |0| You're a dork. _B_ 
 Oh, hey!  |9| Honey wait, Joey, Im sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it  
 Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!  _B_ |2| She's bluffing! 
 This is not a sign! |7| Wait! Oh my God! I cant get out! 
 Im sorry. Youre not easy-going, but youre passionate, and thats good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that Im pretty good about making you feel better about that. And thats good too. So, they can say that youre high maintenance, but its okay, because I like maintaining you. |5| Ahhh! You are on my list. 
 Okay!  |7| Okay, if you really wanna have sex 
 I say we go with Careless Whisper.  |3| What are we gonna do? 
 I can see it from right here. Itll cost you one husband. |5| My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price? 
 Yes, 98.6. Youre gonna be fine. _B_ |0| Okay. Lets hurryOh wait! Do we have a condom?  Oh right!  
 Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college. |8| Oh, you're so sweet.  Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff? 
 Hey! Remember when I had corneas? |6| The sun is out! 
 Hey! Remember when I had corneas? |6| The sun is out! 
 Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York. |8| So who are you? 
 Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone. _B_ |8| Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now. 
 Probably because |4| Is that why you bought all this stuff?!  Well, yknow what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and theres a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that Im not gonna eat! You know why?! 
 Hey! |8|  Hey! 
 Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that Im sorry. Yknow? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset. |1|  Hey. 
 Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade! |8| So, we did okay at the strip club, right? 
 We are switching back, right now! |6|  I had nothing to do with it.   Okay, it was my idea, but I dont feel good about it.  
  If this is the way all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem. |4| Gas? Wow! Intense. 
  What does it say?! |6| Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly its my book to the rescue, huh?  Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up. 
 Great! Okay, here.  |8| I dont know.  Let me see the ring. 
 Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and dont come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my  _B_ The |2| Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece. 
 Yep! |8| Were gonna see each other naked. 
 An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didnt wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy! |8| What? 
 Okay Bob listen uhh, Im the reason you didnt get the job up here. |4| I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is. 
 I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside. |4| Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks... 
 Aaaaand....... hernia. |5| Someday. 
 Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend. _B_ |3| Petrie. 
 I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me? |4| That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied. 
 It's gonna be ok. You know that? |3| Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice. 
 No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work. |7| Uh-huh, yeah. 
  Ill hold you close in my arms.  I cant resist your charms. And love.... |9| Hey, thats never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy! Closing Credits _B_ 
 Will you excuse me I have to um.....  _B_ |1|  Just do it. 
 Oh, this is horrible, its just horrible. |0|  You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and were then gonna go skiing? 
 Can I sleep on your couch?  Closing Credits _B_ |8|  Hey!  Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind? _B_ 
 Oh, yeah... yeah. |5| Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. . 
 Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women So, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, Im either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson. |3| Youre actually going through with this? 
 Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me! |5| Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me. 
 Yeah, well, sorry doesnt bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later. |2| Chandler, I said I was sorry. 
 Its an old key! |6| No, its not a sign! Its a very old key! 
 If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom. |1| Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them. 
 Uh-huh |3| Is it okay for me to come in now? 
  Im off the list.  |5|   I didnt even tell him to say that. . All right youre off my list. 
  Maybe we should give them some privacy. |3| What?! You kissed! 
  Ni-hi-ice! |6| Hey, here you go.  
  Did she see us yet? Did she see us? |0| Chandler? 
 Clunkers?! Oh my god! |3|  Hi! 
 Joey you broke my chair!! |2| Well, it looks like it wasnt healed after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!  
  I dont have your boots. |6| Okay, Im sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots. 
 Do I smell essential oils? |1| Hey. 
 Yeah. |6| You thought about that? 
 Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes. |3| Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.

 Our next cocktail party? |6| So I got it in the junior miss department, big diff. Anyway check it out man, it's gonna make a hell of a conversation piece at out next cocktail party, huh pal? 
  Hey! Joeys |8| Will you excuse me I have to um.....  _B_ 
 Here, here! Closing Credits _B_ End|5| And a crappy New Year. 
 Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but yknow I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? Cause weve had our first fight, and now we can move on. Yknow, I know for me Nicks pants? |4| Oh wow. I really wish youd call me. 
 Well, youre gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, were switching it back! Theres nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe? |2| No, were not! Were not leaving! 
 Joey, can I talk to you for a second?  |7|  Oh! Ohh! Oh!! 
 Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything. |9| I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book. 
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!  And you are about to marry a wonderful man!  Hey! Im marrying a dead woman! _B_ |9|  All right.  
 Count of three? |4| Do you wanna do it at the same time? 
 The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.  |3| Let me see that!  Oh man! 
 Bob! |9| Toby dont. 
 I'm sorry man. |0| No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life. 
  Two hours, that lasted! |0| No he doesnt! 
  Really?! |5| You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In factyes,  Im, Im sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, Im-Im, Im gonna, Im gonna name the baby Chandler. 
 Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.  _B_ |3| Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything? 
 Yeah umm, they're called wallets. End|2| Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldnt have a bag, I justit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial. 
 I love you! |9| Oh my God its old! 
 Now you do that, youre on TV. End|5| I cant do it!  
  So, you busy Thursday? |3| Thanks! 
 Guys?  Ive got something important to tell ya.  Guys?  Guys?!  Im gonna ask Monica to marry me. |2| Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!  And you are about to marry a wonderful man!  Hey! Im marrying a dead woman! _B_ 
 Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up? |9| Do you have a sec? 
 Im sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman? |5| Mrs. Altman? She also made out with Takaka Ci-Kek the night before he went back to Thailand. 
 Well, why dont you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay! |5| Well I dont have them either. Where are they? 
 Okay.  |5| Yeah, Im going to take a bath. Im just going to get a magazine. 
 Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody. |7|  Chandler? 
 Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're notovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed. |1| Uch, you see, I'm ovulating. 
 Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy. |4| How many kids were we gonna have? 
 I know.  |5| She really left. 
 Well, I did and it hurt.  That's when I wrote the |1| I didn't know you knew about that. 
 _B_ You're obviously not their favorite pet. |6| Chandler. 
 Eddie, do you remember yesterday? |7| Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick. 
 You're not a dad. You're not a dad. |5| Nighty-nite. 
  No you know I dont mind. Chandler and |8| Ill be a fool for you. Im sure, you know I dont mind. 
 Yes!! |8| Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler. 
 Look, I may have jumped the gun here.  Um, I just got out of a relationship and Im not really in a, in a commitment kind of place. Joeys |0| Finally, I thought wed never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.  
 Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life. |6| Well, this has been fun. 
 Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one! _B_ |4| Yeah. 
 What? |4| I dont know. 
 Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" Im happy all the time!  |9| Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.  _B_ 
 Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day? |5| Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.  _B_ 
 No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.  |1| Bye!  
 Hey, buddy boy, howd the audition go? |7|  Yknow, suddenly I find you very attractive.  
  I told you I should not wear this color.  |7| Thanks! So are you. 
  It is so good to see you! |8| It's a Thanksgiving miracle! 
  What is going on? The |2|  There it is.  _B_ 
 Two! |7| One! 
 Whats going on? |4| Hey. 
 Well that puts me in a difficult position. _B_ |6| Toby! Im not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler! 
 Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects! |9|  O-Okay! 
 I can't believe the guys missed this. |0| Excellent, that was excellent. 
 OK, Phoebs, your turn. |4| No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do. 
 Thank you, sir. |9| So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so Im happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 830.  Phil! Nice job.  Stevens! Way to go!  Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya!   Bing! Good job, couldnt have done it without ya.  
 I think so. |8| So did you break up with Joanna? 
 _B_ Goodnight. |9| Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. . 
 Yeah, but I bet it works. |9| Well, freaked. Cause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Alices like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket. 
 Okay. Thanks. |7| Yeah, but you have to keep the name too! 
 I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. |3| What are we supposed to be seeing here? 
 Yes. Yes.  |8| Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!! 
 Nice try. |3| Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" Im happy all the time!  
 Okay, how long is this going to go on. |0| Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler? 
  Hey! |8| Eh! Stop it! 
 Are you hugging the door right now.  |4| I love you! 
 Okay. Okay.  What are you gonna do to me if you get the part? |2| Oh, very funny. I dont know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday.  You got me the audition?! Lets hug it up!  
 Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us. |3| I dont know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks. 
 Did she look 16? |8| Hey! She didnt look 50! 
 Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again? |4| Okay.  God well, we gotta go back and get them! 
 L-leaving my troubles behind? |3| What do you think youre doing? 
 Not to shabby, I got this all off myself using my wifes tools.  Oh my God! |4| Oh Rach thats great. Thats great.  _B_ 
 What are you doing here? |6| Hi. Hi. 
  You not gonna believe |3| Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough. 
 Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old. |3| What else did you think about? 
 Lying is wrong! |7| Now, what do you say? 
 No problem roomie.  |4| Thank you. 
 Uhhhaahh. |6| No, that means nothin to me. _B_ 
 Do you remember talking to me yesterday? |5| Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it. 
 I can't believe you got us into trouble. _B_ |3| Not a dad. 
 I know. |5| Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh... 
 Well, you dont you have Captain Hook explain it to her. |6| Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didnt understand the question. 
 Ahhhh, youre not Mary-Angela. Joeys |8| So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips. 
 Yeah, we got, um-hmm. |5|  Hey, dont we have to... 
 Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape. End|0| Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout.  See ya.  
 So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have? |4|  No. Nothing.  Closing Credits _B_ 
 All right, well Im gonna put my sweats back on. |1| No, I dont. 
 I dont care, this is our apartment! And they stoleyou stole itour apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. Im getting back right now!  |4| I dont want to move again! 
 Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. |0| Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets. 
 So you knew we were gonna miss the movie! |7|  Mon  Marcia and Chester are planning on seeing a movie on Sunday night. Marcia thinks theyre supposed to meet at six, Chester thinks its at seven. 
 Im not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.  |1|  Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out. 
 Yeah, check out the ring.  |7| Wait a minute, is this, is this for real? 
 Arent you just a tinsy bit curious? |9| Please, its because otherwise I really dont know what I might do. 
 Three!  |7| Two! Monica and 
 Look  it was a lo-o-ong time ago. |0|  Man... I... I'm sorry. 
 You gotta do it, man. |6| I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.  
 Ross-Joey, Joey-Ross.  |6| Cool!! 
 Why dont you use ours across the hall, cause she has problems. |5| Oh, I  
 Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time. |6| Um, thank you for the gift. 
 Well, I-I guess I gotta go. |3|  This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen. 
 Hey. |8| Hey. 
 You wanna hug it out? |6| Okay! 
 Look, Monica |0| Wait, wait, wait!  
 Yeah-yeah, me neither. _B_ |1| No. 
 Good-good-good-good. |6| Hey! 
 How is that ever going to happen?! |3| I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement Im going to announce that Im pregnant! 
 It's up to you. _B_ |6| Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something. 
 Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise. |3| Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors. 
 Joey! |6| Yeah lady! Give us candy!! 
 My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.  |5| Yeah? 
 Well I think its safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined. |6| Three!  
 Well, youre welcome. And tell them were really glad theyre coming. |9|  Oh. 
 Yknow what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones. |8| Okay, Im never gonna wear them again. I just didnt get a chance to say goodbye. 
 Oh, its so hard to care when youre this relaxed. |4| I know that youre new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum. 
  Youre messy. |4|   How did you get in there?! 
 ...I'm, I'm okay. |4| Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay. 
 Alright! That is it! This is our apartment and you cannot behave this way. Now if you can't act your age, then you shouldn't be here at all. Now, those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out...But they're very important to Monica...And I want you to apologize to her right now. |2| Ew! Ew! Gross gross! _B_ 
 Sure you do. |7|  Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding. 
 I'm a pretty little girl. |5| And?... AND? 
 The cranberries...? |1| the turkey, the stuffing...  
 Sure! |8| Can I ask you a question? 
 Yeah alright. What're these, raisins? |5| Pecan sandy, just made em. 
 So what happened? |0| Uh, yes. 
 Sure. What's up? |3|  Hey.  Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second? 
 Ive found. |6| I know. 
 You hear that! That is her chose, mister Ill let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!  |7| Im sorry, Joey, that is my chose. 
 This is so bad. If-if youre not Mary-Angela, then-then who is? Mary-|2| No, Im Mary-Theresa. 
 What about things that are already gold? |3| Okay well, he would turn things to gold. 
 No. No, not at all, thats-thats ridiculous. |0| Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard!   Well, what about you? Youre not feeling left out or anything are ya? 
 Yeah? |7| Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, yknow what, you were right, you were right. We really werent great at being guys, but you know why? Because were girls. 
 Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You cant offer anything to us! |2| All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer. 
 Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game!  Last night! |9| Yay! 
 That's not funny. |1| This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?  
 Oh the humanity. |7| A lot of other gas smells 
 Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge! |8| Hey! 
 Do you want me to be afraid of you? |4| It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something? 
 Right here!  |7| Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, whats the harm in that? 
  Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!...  Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good!  Whooooaaaa.... Closing Credits _B_ |1| Yeah, where the hell is he? _B_ 
 I think I should get the chair!  |3| Uh-huh! Nice try, but you dont get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap!  No I take that back! 
 So we both finished our vows. |9| Oh thats so sweet. 
 Did it turn into sand? |2| Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor? 
 Eh. I thought that was an alp. |5| That's because I'm in front of them. 
  Hey! |8| You know the book says that whenever she’s sleeping I should be sleeping so…  
 What's the matter with me? Why I'm such a girl? |1| So? Did have sex, right? 
  Oh, she's sorry! I feel better! |1| I'm sorry.. 
 Erica wait! |9| I don't want to look at your file! This is over.  
  Hmm mmmhm.. |6| So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even. 
 I cant believe you came back. |4| Hi. Closing Credits _B_ 
 Its horrible. |0| Excuse me? 
 Uh, the book? |1| No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book. 
 Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel. |4| Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Ill wait for you. Do you even know how long youre going to be gone? 
 Oh-ho, yeah! |8| Youre a pathetic loser, right? 
 It happened in London. |5| How?! When?! 
 This is not going to work. |2| Look!  
 Okay, give me a second!  Did you clean up in here? |3| You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks! 
 What are you doing? |8| Hey-hey-hey! 
 Hey! |8| Hey! 
 Yep, pretty much. |7| So you two are really serious?! 
 Sure, why not? |3| I am? 
 What are you doing? |8| Whats up buddy? 
 Eh!  |6| Eh, we werent that close anyway! 
 And dignity. |9| Pride. 
 Well, she probably wasnt familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings! |6| She didnt photograph well! 
 Okay.  |5| Okay.  All right. 
  Hey! |8| Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now youre just a girl in a tub!  
 I married Fred Sanford! |7| Oh no! You werent supposed to see this! 
 That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever... |5| Listen uh, maybe we could get together later? 
 You sure? |6| No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage. 
  Not to mention the cold sores.  |1| Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus... 
  Not to mention the cold sores.  |1| Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus... 
 Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked. |5| What the hell is that dog doing here?!   
 _B_ Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling? |9| Uh, sure, why not. 
 Oh sweet Moses. |8| We took a road trip to Las Vegas man. 
 Wh-what? |0| Im now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one. 
 Oh, this is soo bad.  Mary-|0|  I am! 
 Okay, lets play my game now. |5| Ahh, his work is done. 
 Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do! |8| Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Dont you? 
 Stripping! |7| And do you know what girls are really good at? 
 Yay! |8| Yay! 
 I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast. |5| Why?! 
  Hey. |8| Bye.  
 Really? |5| Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that. 
 Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way! |8| Chandler, please dont think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel 
 Because you  broke a chair and you  broke a chair! The only one around here that hasnt broke a chair, is me! |0| How do you figure? 
 Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!  |0| Eh!  
  No. No, I wont. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didnt want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot. |1| Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, youll be fine.  
 Oh so there can’t be any yelling. |4| Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep 
 Ok...That's better. Now I want you to apologize to each other, and mean it. Amy & |1| Mon...I'm so sorry. 
 He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him!  |2|  Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible. 
 You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again. |0| I've nothing to say to you.  
  Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody? |0| We are even, right? 
 And, a lemon lime. |5| You got me a cola drink? 
 _B_ Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya. |3| I hate actors. 
 I'm free! I'm free! |4| Oh, he needed some time to grieve.  
 Would you come on! Come on! _B_ Thank you. _B_ |5| Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take? 
 What do you mean? |5| The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it. 
 Well believe it baby! |6|  Oh my God! I cant believe you guys are actually think youre moving in here! 
 Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.  |5| Oh. Well, Ill right you everyday.  15 Yemen Road, Yemen. 
 Hey. |8| Ohh! Thank you. Closing Credits _B_ 
 Totally worth it! |9| As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute. _B_ 
 The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it. |1| IN LONDON!!! 
 You are so great! I love you!  |9| I bet this will work!  
 Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!! |7| I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh? 
 Oh, all right.  End|4| Were just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back. 
 Oh Im so sorry man! Is there anything I can do? |0| I cant believe Im going to lose this job! 
  You have no trouble telling time now right? |7| And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me! 
 No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever! |4| Well just well just let her stay. 
 Oh, you dont know.  Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise? |6| Oh my god!  Youre amazing! 
 Get in here!  Hey, and you can not smoke in here!   Merry Christmas. |9| Waiting for candy. 
 Hey! Howd it go? |8| Yeah, Im sorry.  _B_ 
  You told her?! |4| Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey. 
 No, honey youre not sick! Look, I dont love you because youre organized, I love you in spite of that. |4| No Chandler, you dont understand!  Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? Im yknow Im sick. 
 Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice. |2| I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex. 
 Okay. |5| You got it. 
 I love you so much. |9| Uh-hmm. 
  Really? |5| And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.  
  Really? |5| And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.  
 _B_ Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker. |4| I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you. 
 Ah, there we go. |6| Would you come on! Come on! _B_ Thank you. _B_ 
 Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom!  Hey-hey good lookin!  Varrrrrrrrroom.  All right, Ill leave. My beds so boring. End|1| Oh my God.  Closing Credits _B_ 
 No Joey! No Joey! Dont Joey! Joey! |2| Joey!!! 
 Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper. Closing Credits _B_ |1|  Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know. 
 Okay! |7| Yayohyay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now! 
 Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge. |0| That game should not be played without my supervision. 
 I know.  |5| She really left. 
 Oh well you're the best. You come here to me. |9| Of course! 
 Thats totally understandable. |6| Well I did. I really did. And you guys, Ive got to say, Im sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something. 
 Okay. |5| It was a mistake. Please dont take this to mean anything, because it doesnt. 
  HeyyyyWhat? |9| And-and-and-and-and-and, and were gonna be friends again! 
 Well, wheres the logic in that?! |2| No-no-no! This chairs not going anywhere. 
 Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e  |8| Hey! 
 We’re moving to Tulsa |7| No. 
 By the way, that fight was totally arousing. |3| Sorry.

 Run! Run you crazy, rich freak! |4| Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, hes just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just... 
  Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell." |3| Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find. 
 No! |2| Chandler?

 Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking! |1| What? 
 All right.  |5| Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me? 
 Wha- |0| I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!  
 Really? |5| Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you. 
 Quick! What time is it?!  |4| No!

 Why? Mr. |2| Chandler, Im gonna have you arrested. 
 Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet. |9| Really? You promise you wont tell anyone? 
 Here, here! _B_ |6| And a crappy New Year.

She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and Ill bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right? The |3| We want candy! We want candy now!  
 So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!  |1| The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!

 Were back! |6| There you go!  
 Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh!  I can’t, I can’t hear you.  _B_ |9|  What!?

  Hey Ross, look what I've got going here. |9| Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.  
 But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?  |5| Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong.  
 Hey.  Phoebe, Ross, |8| Hi! Oh my gosh!  
 Hey.  Phoebe, Ross, |8| Hi! Oh my gosh!  
 Uh, yes, yes it is. |1| Uh, is your name Chandler? 
 Were not gonna lose to girls. |4| Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls. 
 Y'know what, I can handle it, handles my middle name. Actually its the ah, middle part of my first name. |3| I-I cant handle this, you guys. 
 Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend. |7| You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him. 
 Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane! |5| Chandler! 
 What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?" |1| Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves! 
 No I didn't! |1| You said you loved me! I can't believe this! 
 What is it? |4| Wha- Joey and 
 Oh yeah! |8| So we can go out again?

 Hi, how are ya? |9| Yeah? Well, I dont want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.  
  I dont care, she slept with me. |4| Look, I am so so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that Im not. Im not even close. And I dont know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that thats dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!  
 So you understand, Id feel a lot more comfortable if you didnt tell people what happened. Yknow, Im a little Im a little embarrassed about it. Mr. |4| I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  youre burning in hell!! _B_ 
 Yknow when I said that because were getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets? |3| I dont know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?!  What are you laughing at Pampers?  
 Well, I ended up telling her everything. |1| Helen drinks.  Will you marry me?  _B_ 
 Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds. |2|  I dont like this anymore.  
 Hey. |8| Well its just umm Im afraid you might mess it up. _B_ 
 The floating heads do make a good point. |0|  Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh? 
 You still want that baby?  |3| But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?  
 Soo... you girls having fun? |8| That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all.  
  Oh, really? |3|  We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob  
 May I help you? |7| Is anyone else starting to really like him? _B_ _B_ 
 Bullies, big bullies. LITTLE |5| Cannot feel my tounge. _B_ 
 Because that would be crazy? _B_ |3| No, not the used wax. 
 Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldnt picture myself with any of them.  |4| Come on! Chandler!

 What did you do when they found out? Mr. |3| I understand completely, theres nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer. 
 Yeah that was stupid. Lets not do that. |0| Yeah? 
 Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing.  Little |6| Oh, howd she take it?

 So technically, would this person be in the wedding? |6|  You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle. 
 Man, those two dogs are going at it! |9| Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences. 
 Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel. |7| Oh, okay. Will you take my place? 
 Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore. _B_ |2| Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.

  I'm sorry too. |0| I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist.  All right Joey, we get it.  I'm sorry. 
 And Im blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it,  "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment." |2|  I knew it!! Yknow, youre not so quiet yourself, missy! 
  I-I cant believe Jills gone.  I cant help it, I opened a gate. End|2| Bye.

 Monica! Wait! |9| Yknow what? Im gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper , and youre gonna get a stripper.  
 I know. |5| We can't afford that. 
 Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do? |0| Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way. 
 Well I, I think we'd remember something like that. |8| No he, he moved out and I moved in. 
 Alright, let's do this. LITTLE |3| It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.

 Yeah, thats kinda a relief. |7| Thats kinda nice. 
 Fun's over! |0| I guess I'm done. 
  I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you. |3| Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to. 
  Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe. |6| This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand  twice? Huh? 
  It still doesnt work. |4| I can fix it. Hold on.  Look out. Look out.  
 At a fake game!! |2| Im sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.

 Hi.  Okay, youre too late okay? Because shes already with our guy. |0| Hi. 
 Okay.  |5| Oh thank you. 
 Feelings, such strong feelings. |7| Thats right. Thats right. And that is why you cant stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldnt come to the wedding. 
  All right! I found one that fits! |7| Ive had better. Ending Credits _B_

 I never want to leave you again! |8| Got ya.  
 Are you actually saying these words? _B_ |3| Well y'know, Ive been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a take notice walk.

 Yeah? |7| Yeah, were gonna be fine! Get out! 
 Because, I-I shouldve called! Yknow if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never wouldve gone out with Nick, and they wouldve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples! |0| How? How is your fault? 
 No! |2| Ohh, you are so lucky!  Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up? 
 Ho-oh, hes gonna get some!  Of the glare from the streetlight out of his apartment. Yknow so umm, hes closed the drapes there so he can have a nice, pleasant conversation with your little sister.  Well, Im off to bed!  To Be Continued Ending Credits  End|7| Oh.

 Umm? |0| Y'know what? 
 Where I dont want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!! _B_ |4| Oh! What is that? What is that? 
 Richard was there so I couldnt do it! |8| What happened? 
 Yup. |7| Broke em all huh? 
  Yeah, alright. End|5|  If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars! 
 That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling. |7| Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner. 
 _B_ Yeah, I remember. |6| Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.

 Nope. _B_ |3| You going to tell her? 
 Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do? |0| What, you, you really quit your job? 
 You go back to work tomorrow night, right? |6| Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these...  Ow!

 Oh, its not important? Its not important?! If it wasnt for a bridesmaid youd be marrying him  not me! |3| No, because it-it didnt seem important. 
 Yknow its funny I started it but, now its scaring me. So could you come out here please? |3| No! We only mess around at his place! 
  So, you feel like a dad yet? |5| Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.

  I'll do it. |4| Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle. 
 I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place? |1| He paid a lot of money for it.

 I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it. |6| Oh my god! 
 What are you singing? |7| Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this.  You like that, right?  
 I just didn't want to tell you in front of them. |5| Oh my God! 
 Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so. _B_ |1| So, I guess this is it. 
 Im sorry. Im-Im-Im sorry that I said I was going to when Im not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isnt Rachels fault. Its me.

 Yeah, o-okay. |6| Well, this isnt how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty. 
 I did! But the store wouldnt take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?  |3|  Ohhh.  Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today. 
 Hey. |8| Mr. Geller.

 If they cant find a home for her, they kill her! And Im not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine! |1| I did! But the store wouldnt take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?  
 And yet, shes still not hanging up the phone. |6| Sorry, Im so sorry, I will pay you back. 
 Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You dont need that kindve hurt. Take it from a guy whos never had a long term relationship...... |2| Thats not true! Her, she doesnt even know what she wants! Rachels still mad about the whole thing. 
 Thats right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind. |3| Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesnt know for sure, so just throw her off the track.

Thats not fair! Its not my fault! I was off with my bridesmaid! And whos to say I wouldve even said yes?!  I mean I wouldve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way too big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!

 Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse. |4| Yeah? How'd it go?

 That's a good idea. I wonder where I could  get a basket of porn |1| Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry. 
 No, the doctors say it may kill her. |2| She doesnt know she was fired yet, does she? 
 Oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites.  Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you. |6| What are you up too?

 You ready? |8| Hi! 
 Yeah, well Yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh? |2| Well thats a little crazy. Although I am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet. 
 Oh whats the matter? Are you scared? |4| Chandler please! 
  Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools! |2| Chandler, where are your tools? 
 It's seven years ago.  My time machine works! |5| That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.

 For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents. |2| Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time. 
 Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done? |6| Oh, OK, I don't eat meat. 
  They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what? |9| Oh, honey, the earrings

 I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?' |2| OK, then, eat me, I'm done. 
 Thats a bad duck!!!  Howd the thing go tonight, Ross? |1|  Thats a duck. 
 Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper.  End|0| No, I meant with the dropper over here.  
 So what was it for anyway? |2| Oh thats all right! Yknow, I ended up having a really good time. Yknow, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness. 
 Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator? |1| What did you say? 
 Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH! |4| It's really starting to hurt. 
 Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter. |2| Oh my God! That's wild! 
  Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy!  _B_ |4| Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on.  Easy. 
 How did the job stuff go? |3| Should we send something? 
 Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops. |0| Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes. 
 I'm not playing with you. |5| So, we're just four losers... SUPER! 
 I'm not playing with you. |5| So, we're just four losers... SUPER!

 That really was an incredible wedding. |8| I got married!  Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.   _B_ 
 Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there. |4| But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?

 My cranberries! |8| PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!  
 Hey. Do you want this scone?  It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you! |7| Hey. 
 Seriously, where did this happen? |0| Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed. 
 I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had. |4| It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage? 
 You want me to wear your panties? |5| Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner. 
 Yeah. End|0| Ahh, to be 13 again. 
 Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!  |3| We could, or we can have sex in it.

 She gets crazy! This scar  is from Pictionary!  |9| Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!

 Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on? |3| Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples' coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first. 
 I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.  |0| Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross? 
 Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell. _B_ |0| Could ya? 
 How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first! |5| No-hey-no! If you dont want me to do it, I accept that. I dont care about that. I just I dont want you to be upset. 
 If its not, then theres two of them. And that would mean its the end of the world! _B_ |0| Does that sound like Janice? 
 What's going on? |2|  I don't care.  
 I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed. |4| Mine. 
 Really? What happened? |0| I have a problem. 
 Thats what you should say. |5| Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! Youre so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, cause you guys are perfect for each other. Yknow, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just it-it fits. Yknow? And you just know its gonna last forever. 
  Oh dear God, there's two of them! |5| Oh, by the way... I'm awesome!!

 Hi. |8| Hey! 
 You can't move at all? |1| Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman, No Cry" and I got stuck. 
 When youre marrying us; thats what you should say. |6| What? 
 Are you serious?  |2| WE'RE GETTING A BABY! 
  Did you know this about him? |3| Hell, yeah! 
  Did you know this about him? |3| Hell, yeah! 
 If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose? |2| Oh, well, I can move...  
 Id love it if you would do it. |9| Really? I can do it? 
 How did you guys find me? I knew I shouldve hid at the gym! |3| So this is your office? 
 Weirdest thing. Did I hearMother of God its true! |4| Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when youre trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass? 
  Some of these look a little frayed. |4|  I guess so... 
  What did you do? Closing Credits _B_ |4|  See ya.  
 But those are the words! Those exact words! |9| Hey!  
 Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that Im related to Monica. How is she? |3| What the hell are you doing?! 
  See you later Mon. |8| All right baby, come on!  Yes! Yes! I am on fire! 
 Jan-Janice! |6| Chandler Bing!

 No! No! No! I cant do that! |0| Shes fine. She doesnt know youre gone. And she doesnt have to know, okay? Now come on, were going home. 
 What does it look like? I'm going home. |3| Wait Chandler, what are you doing?! 
 Chicks dont swim. |6| What about the chick? 
 Because if I go home, were gonna become the Bings! I cant be the Bings! |9| Why not?! 
 Janice I didnt even know you were pregnant! Whos the unwitting human whos essence youve stolen? |5| Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler. 
 Come on! I was there!  I know he's the love of your life. |3| What? Wait! Why?  Chandler! Chandler! Wait! Im sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me! 
  OK! |7|  One thousand... 
  OK! |7|  One thousand... 
 What did I marry into?  _B_  |3| You were my first kiss ever? 
 I dont know. Should we try it? |4| Are you sure? 
 The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games! |0| Whats wrong with being the Bings? 
 What?! |3| Its you. This is yours. 
 Really?! |5| Not any more. 
 That is the exact same thing.|0| Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys "R" Us... She was in stock! 
 See, I told you they dont swim.  |3| Sure.  
 No. |4| Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room? 
 Thats funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt? _B_ |8|  Look how nervous he gets! We havent slept together in years!  
 Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him! |3|  No...  Either of you girls got a quarter? 
 Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him! |3|  No...  Either of you girls got a quarter? 
 Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing. _B_ |0| Really!  All right? Let's forget about this going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary.  Okay, this is empty. 
 Noo!  Oh, its okay, its okay, baby, baby, baby.  End|0|  Wait. Give him a minute. 
 Its not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybodys! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And Ive met me; I am not Paul Newman. I dont race cars! I dont make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity. |4| Then you are neither of your parents! 
 I want to. I love her so much, but Im afr Its too huge. |6| But look Chandler, right now no-one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this. 
 We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this. |6| Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...  
 We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this. |6| Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...  
 Well yeah, but then |5| Yknow, okay. Youre right. It is huge. So why dont we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower? 
 Im sorry youre here with me instead of Roger. |1| How hot is this?! _B_ 
 Really? You got us a chick and a duck? |6| Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!  
 Really? You got us a chick and a duck? |6| Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!  
 Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Lets take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs dont mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and thats just an ordinary pig not even a pig thats good at sports! |1| So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you dont really believe that do you? 
 Depends on what you mean by we. _B_ |6|  YeahNo-but-but-but-but! Were just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, thats not scary right? 
 Well, I could make it seem like hes here.  "Heres some little known facts about cous-cous. They didnt add the second cous until 1979."  |6| Yeah, me too. 
 If marriage worked, Id be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%. |1| Yeah, but thats pigs not people! 
 Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me? |8| Look what I found in the drawer...  And you said I'd never wear this... 
 Oh, don't worry, we'll find them. |9| Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone! 
 Oh, don't worry, we'll find them. |9| Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone! 
 Okay. |5| Stop it!! Thats not funny!! 
 Well, never say never but yknow probably uh yeah, never. |1| Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married? 
 I think you know. |7| Sure, what do you have in mind? 
 Alright.  |5| Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins. 
 Alright.  |5| Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins. 
 What was tonight? |4| Im sorry, okay? It justtonight was supposed to be yknow, it was supposed to be a big deal. 
 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why dont you put down your copy of The Rules huh mantrap?! |7| Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?! 
 Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important. |8| So are guys doing okay? 
 This is what I want to do. |4| Really? I don't really feel like it. 
 Okay.  What was tonight? |2| You dont want to know what tonight was. 
 It's okay, it's just an egg roll. |4| Oh! 
 It's okay, it's just an egg roll. |4| Oh! 
  Its okay, I got a plan. _B_ |4| Yknow what?! I gotta go! Ugh!  
  She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.|5| Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.

 Okay, let's find these birds. |3| Just put it on a plate and leave.

 Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it. |8| How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over? 
 Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy? |9| I was just waiting for the perfect guy. 
 Well, that can't be good! |5| Oh! They're in the table! 
 Well, that can't be good! |5| Oh! They're in the table! 
 Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa _B_ They do have the shrimp. |4| I want you right here, right now.

 Oh my God, I cant believe this! Yknow, I thought I thought you were a good guy. |2| Well she said she had to think things over. 
 Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didnt tell my girlfriend that you love her? |2| Oh, hey look nothing happened. 
  Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum! |7| All right.  
 Yknow what? I cant believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!! |3| Well all right, one thing happened? 
 Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out? |8| What are you doing? 
 And what does she have to think about? I love her! |7| Well Im sorry. 
 Where's Ross? |1| Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway. 
 Where's Ross? |1| Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway. 
 Okay!  This is it!  We're gonna get married! |9| No, only because that's the graduation song.  
 But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, yknow? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, shed be surprised! |3| Well, apparently Im willing to offer her things that you are not. 
 It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isnt fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake!  I was gonna propose tonight. |3| Well if it helps, it worked very well. 
 Yeah I even  got a ring.  Did you get a ring? |0| You were gonna propose?  
  Okay to come in? |2| Try telling my wife that. _B_ 
 Yknow Richard you are a good guy. |6| No I dont have a ring!  You go get her Chandler.  And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, dont let her go. Trust me. 
 Yeah I know, guess who beeped him? |0| Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again. 
 I cant talk to you now, I gotta find Monica! |6| Dude! 
 Im the ruptured spleen.  |1| What?! 
 What? |4| Shes gone. 
 Because you shouldnt be with him.  You should be with me. |6| Why would you do that? 
 What are you talking about? |5| Shes gone. She had a bag and she left. 
 Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they dont just happen. Yknow? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning yknow I was just lying there and I couldnt wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always yknow with a friend. |4| Really? 
 Well why didnt you stop her?! Why didnt you just tell her it was a plan?! |2| She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think. 
 I know you probably dont want to go out with me, yknow because I make too many jokes and Ive never been in a serious relationship and I guess Im not technically a "doctor "  |2| Chandler! 
 Well where Where did she go? |1| I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldnt believe me. 
 No, there were two. |2| There was just one woman, wasnt there? 
 I cant believe I ruined this. |2| To her parents I think and she said you shouldnt call her. But if I were you I would. 
 Oh yeah. Ending Credits _B_ |1| Including me? 
 Oh my God.  |4| You wanted it to be a surprise.  
 Okay!  Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought  Wait a minute, I-I can do this.  I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you,  you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.
